It was reported (https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231) that reading an HTTP/2 trailer could mess up future trailers since the stored size was one byte less than required. The problem is that the code that creates HTTP/1-like headers from the HTTP/2 trailer data once appended a string like `:` to the target buffer, while this was recently changed to `: ` (a space was added after the colon) but the following math wasn't updated correspondingly. When accessed, the data is read out of bounds and causes either a crash or that the (too large) data gets passed to client write. This could lead to a denial-of-service situation or an information disclosure if someone has a service that echoes back or uses the trailers for something.|2018-01-24|6.4|None|125|https://www.cvedetails.com/cwe-details/125/cwe.html|CWE - 125 : Out-of-bounds Read|ParentOf,126,Buffer Over-read;ChildOf,119,Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer;CanFollow,822,Untrusted Pointer Dereference;ParentOf,127,Buffer Under-read;CanFollow,823,Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset;CanFollow,825,Expired Pointer Dereference;MemberOf,1218,Memory Buffer Errors;CanFollow,824,Access of Uninitialized Pointer|OS,Canonical,Ubuntu Linux,14.04;OS,Canonical,Ubuntu Linux,16.04;OS,Canonical,Ubuntu Linux,17.10;OS,Debian,Debian Linux,8.0;OS,Debian,Debian Linux,9.0;Application,Haxx,Libcurl,*

182|CVE-2018-1000030|https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-1000030/|Python 2.7.14 is vulnerable to a Heap-Buffer-Overflow as well as a Heap-Use-After-Free. Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue deserves a CVE.|2018-02-08|3.3|Overflow,Memory corruption|787|https://www.cvedetails.com/cwe-details/787/cwe.html|CWE - 787 : Out-of-bounds Write|ChildOf,119,Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer;CanFollow,822,Untrusted Pointer Dereference;ParentOf,121,Stack-based Buffer Overflow;ParentOf,124,Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow');ParentOf,122,Heap-based Buffer Overflow;CanFollow,823,Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset;ParentOf,123,Write-what-where Condition;CanFollow,825,Expired Pointer Dereference;MemberOf,1218,Memory Buffer Errors;CanFollow,824,Access of Uninitialized Pointer|OS,Canonical,Ubuntu Linux,12.04;OS,Canonical,Ubuntu Linux,14.04;OS,Canonical,Ubuntu Linux,16.04;OS,Canonical,Ubuntu Linux,18.04;Application,Python,Python,*
