Mitigating Factors for Directory Traversal Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0204:

Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
Systems can only be vulnerable if they have Internet Information Services (IIS) installed.
The attack is only effective against files where the IIS worker process that is hosting the CrystalDecisions.Web.dll file has delete permissions.

Visual Studio .NET 2003

By default, the IIS worker process that hosts the component that is used to exploit this vulnerability is configured to run under different security contexts, depending on the operating system and server role. All of these accounts are limited type accounts with limited access to resources that are on the system.

On Windows 2000 and Windows XP, the machine\ASPNET account is the default security context.
On Windows 2000 domain controllers, the IWAM_MACHINE account is be the default security context.
On Windows Server 2003 (IIS Worker Process Isolation Mode), the Network Service account is the default security context.
On Windows Server 2003 (IIS5 Compatibility Mode), the machine\ASPNET account is the default security context.
On Windows Server 2003 domain controllers, the Network Service account is the default security context.


Systems that have Visual Studio .NET 2003 installed are vulnerable only if IIS was installed on the system when Visual Studio was installed, and if IIS is still installed.

Outlook 2003 with Business Contact Manager

By default, the IIS worker process that hosts the component that is used to exploit this vulnerability is configured to run under different security contexts, depending on the operating system and server role. All of these accounts are limited type accounts with limited access to resources that are on the system.
Systems that have Outlook 2003 with Business Contact Manager installed are vulnerable only if IIS was present on the system when Business Contact Manager was installed.
Outlook with Business Contact Manager is not part of a default install of Outlook 2003 but is available on a separate CD, together with Microsoft Office Small Business Edition 2003 and Microsoft Office Professional Edition 2003.
