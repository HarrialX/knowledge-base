Mitigating Factors for Task Scheduler Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0212:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.
Windows Server 2003 is not affected by this vulnerability. Windows NT 4.0 is not vulnerable unless Internet Explorer 6 is installed. Internet Explorer 6 is not affected when installed on other supported operating systems. Other versions Internet Explorer are not affected.
