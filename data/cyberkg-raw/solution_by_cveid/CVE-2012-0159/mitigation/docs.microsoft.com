Mitigating Factors for Lync Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1849
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
