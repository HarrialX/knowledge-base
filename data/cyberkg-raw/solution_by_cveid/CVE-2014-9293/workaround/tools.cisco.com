Instructions:
Mitigations involve preventing the device from processing NTP control queries. In products that allow for editing the ntp.conf file, this is accomplished by the restrict directive. Other products may support ntp access-group commands which can be used to filter NTP control queries. Potential workarounds for each affected Cisco product is referenced in the Cisco Bug ID workarounds section.

Mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices in a network are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion document for this advisory:
