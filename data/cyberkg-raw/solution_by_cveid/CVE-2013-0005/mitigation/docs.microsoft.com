Mitigating Factors for Replace Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2013-0005
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
Systems running Windows Server 2012 in its default configuration are not at risk from this vulnerability since the Management OData IIS extension is not enabled by default. Only Windows Server 2012 systems where the Management OData IIS extension has been enabled are vulnerable.
