Workarounds for File Converter Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1533
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

For Word 2000 and Word 2002, disable the Works 4.x converter by restricting access
An administrator can apply an access control list to affected converters to ensure that the converters are no longer loaded by Works and Office. This effectively prevents exploitation of the vulnerability using this attack vector.
For Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003
Run the following command from a command prompt:
cacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv" /E /P everyone:N
cacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv" /E /P everyone:N

For Vista / Server 2008
Run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:
takeown /f "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv" 
icacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv" /save works432_ACL.TXT
icacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv" /deny everyone:(F)
takeown /f "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv"
icacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv" /save works432_ACL.TXT
icacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv" /deny everyone:(F)

Impact of workaround. Upon implementing the workaround, the user will no longer be able to open or save Works 4.x documents. Attempting to open a Works 4.x document will return an error saying, "The file appears to be corrupted."

For Word 2003 with the Microsoft Works 6–9 File Converter and Word 2007, disable the Works 6-9 converter by restricting access
An administrator can apply an access control list to affected converters to ensure that the converter is no longer loaded by Works and Office. This effectively prevents exploitation of the vulnerability using this attack vector.
For Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003
Run the following command from a command prompt:
cacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv" /E /P everyone:N
cacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv" /E /P everyone:N

For Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008
Run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:
takeown /f "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv"
icacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv" /save works632_ACL.TXT
icacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv" /deny everyone:(F)
takeown /f "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv"
icacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv" /save works632_ACL.TXT
icacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv" /deny everyone:(F)

Impact of workaround. Upon implementing the workaround, the user will no longer be able to open or save Works 6-9 documents. Attempting to open a Works 6-9 document will return an error saying, "The file appears to be corrupted."
