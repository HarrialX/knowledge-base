Step 2 Append /safe to the WINWORD.EXE Command Line
For Enterprise Customers
Using Word in Safe Mode helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.
All versions of Word have an application recovery feature that allows running Word in Safe mode. Safe mode disables the functionality and prevents vulnerable code from being exploited. The full set of limitations can be found at: http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/assistance/HP030823931033.aspx.

Word will display SAFE MODE in the title bar if it is operating in Safe Mode.
Right-click your desktop.
Select New/Shortcut.
Select Browse.
Locate winword.exe**.**
Append “ /safe” (without quotes) to the end of the file location, after the quotation mark.
Click Next, and name your shortcut as “Word Safe Mode”.
Click Finish.

To open a Word document, follow the steps listed below:

Save your Word document to a disk or to your desktop.
Start Word using your “Word Safe Mode” shortcut.
Click File, click Open, and then browse to the document you want to open.

Enterprise Customers Using Group Policy
Domain administrators can use Group Policy to enable Safe Mode for. You do not have to restart the computer to implement this mitigation.
Note Even after applying the workarounds that implements a registry change, do not open Word files directly from e-mail clients other than Outlook, for example MSN Hotmail, by double-clicking them
For information on using registry keys with a Group Policy see Using Administrative Template Files with Registry-Based Group Policy and Distributing Registry Changes.
Note Exact locations of registry keys depend on installation paths for Office used in each corporation. Registry keys will have to be determined by IT administrators to match their unique installation paths. The locations listed in the examples above correspond to the default installation paths for Microsoft Office. For example the default path for Office 10 on English Windows would be "c:\program files\microsoft office\office10".
Note To ensure Word is being loaded in Safe Mode when opening, editing or printing documents, the ‘Default’ and ‘Command’ registry values in the following registry keys should be edited to include the “/safe” command line parameter (without the quotes).
For example, if Office 2003 is installed the ‘Default’ value should be changed to look like this: "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\OFFICE11\WINWORD.EXE" /n /dde /safe, and the ‘Command’ value should be changed to look like this: “']gAVn-}f(ZXfeAR6.jiWORDFiles>P`os,1@SW=P7v6GPl]Xh /n /dde /safe”.
Note The ‘Command’ value is an encoded string that is version-specific and language-specific, and it may not appear exactly as shown above on all systems.
