Mitigating Factors for SMB Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4834
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. In this case, the SMB ports should be blocked from the Internet.
Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 are not affected by this vulnerability.

Mitigating Factors for SMB Validation Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4835
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. In this case, the SMB ports should be blocked from the Internet.
All supported editions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 have file sharing disabled by default, which reduces the exposure of these platforms to this vulnerability. This default configuration, which is a change from earlier platforms, results in a reduced attack surface for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, and reduces the severity rating for this vulnerability to Moderate for these platforms.
