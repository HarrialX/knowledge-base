Workarounds for .NET Framework Memory Access Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1855
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Disable XAML browser applications in Internet Explorer
To help protect against this vulnerability, change your settings to prompt before running XAML browser applications (XBAPs) or to disable XBAPs in the Internet and Local intranet security zones as follows:

In Internet Explorer, click the Tools menu and then select Internet Options.
Click the Security tab, click Internet, and then click Custom level. Under Settings, for Loose XAML, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.
Click the Security tab, click Internet, and then click Custom level. Under Settings, for XAML browser applications, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.
Click the Security tab, click Internet, and then click Custom level. Under Settings, for XPS documents, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.
On the Security tab, click Custom level. Under .NET Framework-reliant components, set Run components not signed with Authenticode to either Prompt or Disable, and then click OK. Repeat this step for Run components signed with Authenticode, and then click OK.
Click Local intranet, and then click Custom Level. Repeat steps 3 and 4. If you are prompted to confirm that you want to change these settings, click Yes. Click OK to return to Internet Explorer.

Impact of workaround. Microsoft .NET code will not run in Internet Explorer or will not run without prompting. Disabling Microsoft .NET applications and components in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.
Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone
After you set Internet Explorer to disable XAML browser applications or require a prompt before it runs Loose XAML, XAML browser applications, or XPS documents in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.
To do this, perform the following steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Tools, click Internet Options, and then click the Security tab.
In the Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings box, click Trusted Sites, and then click Sites.
If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone check box.
In the Add this Web site to the zone box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click Add.
Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
Click OK two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

Note Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are *.windowsupdate.microsoft.com and *.update.microsoft.com. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
How to undo the workaround. Perform the following steps:

In Internet Explorer, click the Tools menu, and then select Internet Options.
Click the Security tab, click Reset all zones to default level, and then click OK.
