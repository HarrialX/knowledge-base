#### Mitigating Factors for MS Paint Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0028
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   By default, when a user double-clicks a JPEG file, the file will be opened in the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must convince the user to open the specially crafted file in Microsoft Paint.  
-   An attacker could send the specially crafted file as an e-mail attachment, but the attacker would have to convince the user to open the attachment in Microsoft Paint in order to exploit the vulnerability.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
