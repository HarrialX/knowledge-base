Workarounds for TLS Protocol Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1870
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Prioritize the RC4 Algorithm in server software on systems running Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, or Windows Server 2008 R2
The attack only affects cipher suites that use symmetric encryption algorithms in CBC mode, such as AES, and does not affect the RC4 algorithm. You can prioritize the RC4 algorithm in server software in order to facilitate secure communication using RC4 instead of CBC. Refer to this MSDN article, Prioritizing Schannel Cipher Suites, to learn how to perform this operation.
WarningÂ The client or server with which you are communicating must support the RC4 algorithm. If support for RC4 is not available, a different cipher suite will be used if one is available, and this workaround will be ineffective.
