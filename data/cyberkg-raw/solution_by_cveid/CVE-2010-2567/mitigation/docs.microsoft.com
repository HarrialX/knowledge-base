#### Mitigating Factors for RPC Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2567
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factor may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   The attacker must convince the user to initiate an RPC connection to a malicious server under the attacker's control. An attacker could not remotely exploit this vulnerability without user interaction.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
