Mitigating Factors for Object Packager Insecure Executable Launching Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0009
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

For an attack to be successful, a user must visit an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share and open a legitimate file.
The file sharing protocol, Server Message Block (SMB), is often disabled on the perimeter firewall. This limits the potential attack vectors for this vulnerability.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
