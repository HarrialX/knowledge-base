Mitigating Factors for Collisions in HashTable May Cause DoS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3414
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

By default, IIS is not enabled on any Windows operating system
Sites that disallow application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data HTTP content types are not vulnerable

This vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to produce information that could be used to try to further compromise user information.
By default, installing ASP.NET does not enable Forms Authentication. It has to be explicitly configured per-application to be enabled.
By default, IIS is not installed.
By default, ASP.NET is not installed when .NET Framework is installed. Only customers who manually install and enable ASP.NET are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.
The attacker would have to convince the user to click a link in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Mitigating Factors for ASP.Net Forms Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3416

By default, ASP.NET responses are not cached by the OutputCache. The developer of the site has to opt in to output caching through the OutputCache directive on a page.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the target user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
By default, IIS is not installed on any affected operating system version. Only customers who manually install this are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.
By default, ASP.NET is not installed when .NET is installed. Only customers who manually install and enable ASP.NET are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.
