Mitigating Factors for NNTP Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0574:

Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. If the affected NNTP Ports (119 and 563) are blocked at the firewall, external attacks attempting to exploit this vulnerability could be blocked.
Windows NT Server 4.0, Windows 2000 Server, and Windows Server 2003 are at a reduced risk from this vulnerability because the affected component is not installed by default. Even if Internet Information Services is installed, the affected component is not installed by default. An administrator must manually install the affected component for a system to become vulnerable to this issue.
Exchange 2000 Server and Exchange Server 2003 require the installation of the affected operating system component. However upon installation, Exchange Server 2003 disables the affected operating system component. Exchange Server 2003 requires an administrator to manually re-enable this component to become vulnerable to this issue. Exchange 2000 Server does not disable this component by default when it is installed. However, if an administrator manually disables this component after installing Exchange Server 2000, the system is not vulnerable to this issue. Best practice recommendations for helping to secure Exchange 2000 Server include disabling the affected operating system component.
