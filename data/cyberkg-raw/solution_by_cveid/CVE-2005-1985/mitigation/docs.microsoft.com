Mitigating Factors for Client Service for NetWare Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1985:

Windows XP Home Edition is not vulnerable to this issue. Windows XP Home Edition does not contain the vulnerable component.
By default, the Client Service for NetWare is not installed on any affected operating system version. Only customers who manually install this service are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.
If CSNW is manually installed on Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, an attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users on this operating system version.
For customers who require the affected component, firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
