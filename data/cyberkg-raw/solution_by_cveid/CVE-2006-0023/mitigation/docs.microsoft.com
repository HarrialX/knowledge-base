#### Mitigating Factors for Permissive Windows Services DACLs could allow elevation of privilege - CVE-2006-0023
  
-   An attacker must have valid logon credentials to be able to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited by anonymous users.  
-   Four of the six services identified (NetBT, SCardSvr, DHCP, DnsCache) require an attacker to already be running in a privileged security context. Additionally, the two services, SSDPSRV and UPNPHost, which allow an authenticated user to attack a vulnerable system are only vulnerable on Windows XP Service Pack 1.
