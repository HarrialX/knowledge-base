#### Workarounds for Help Center URL Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1885
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Unregister the HCP Protocol**
  
**Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2229593](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2229593) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround.
  
**Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
  
Unregistering the HCP Protocol prevents this issue from being exploited on affected systems.
  
**Using the Interactive Method**
  
1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**  
2.  Locate and then click the following registry key:  
    HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\\HCP  
3.  Click the **File** menu and select **Export**  
4.  In the Export Registry File dialog box, enter **HCP\_Procotol\_Backup.reg** and click **Save**.  
    **Note** This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default.  
5.  Press the **Delete** key on the keyboard to delete the registry key. When prompted to delete the registry key via the Confirm Key Delete dialog box, click **Yes**.
  
**Using a Managed Deployment Script**
  
1.  Create a backup copy of the registry keys by using a managed deployment script that contains the following commands:  
    Regedit.exe /e HCP\_Protocol\_Backup.reg HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\\HCP  
2.  Next, save the following to a file with a .REG extension, such as Disable\_HCP\_Protocol.reg:  
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
    \[-HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\\HCP\]  
3.  Run the above registry script on the target machine with the following command from an elevated command prompt:  
    Regedit.exe /s Disable\_HCP\_Protocol.reg
  
**Impact of Workaround:** Unregistering the HCP protocol will break all local, legitimate help links that use hcp://. For example, links in Control Panel may no longer work.
  
**How to undo the workaround**
  
Using the interactive method
  
1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.  
2.  Click the **File** menu and select **Import**.  
3.  In the Import Registry File dialog box, select **HCP\_Procotol\_Backup.reg** and click **Open**.
  
Using a Managed Deployment Script
  
-   Restore the original state by running the following command:  
    Regedit.exe /s HCP\_Protocol\_Backup.reg
