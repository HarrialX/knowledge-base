Instructions:
Administrators can restrict the Docker Engine port to bind to localhost (127.0.0.1) following the procedure below:


Issue the su command to obtain sudo privileges
Enter the system directory using the following command cd /etc/systemd/system/
Edit the docker.socket file with your chosen editor and change the ListenStream value to the following:

ListenStream=127.0.0.1:2375
    

Reload with the systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart docker command

In addition, administrators can use the cloud provider security group or external firewall devices in private cloud deployment to restrict access to the CCO Docker Engine management port as per product documentation:
