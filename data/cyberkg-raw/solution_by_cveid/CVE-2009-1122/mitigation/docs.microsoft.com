#### Mitigating Factors for IIS 5.0 WebDAV Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1122
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   Microsoft Internet Information Services versions 5.1, 6.0, and 7.0 are not affected by this vulnerability.  
-   **The anonymous user account is denied write access by default**. In order to successfully exploit this vulnerability with write access, the anonymous user account would need to have write access ACLs set within the IIS folder structure. However, by default, the anonymous user account only has read access ACLs set. On IIS 6.0, there is an explicit deny access control entry (ACE) for write permissions for the default anonymous user account. Unless overridden by the administrator, this deny ACE will be inherited by all children under the default Web site root.  
-   **File system ACLs are enforced**. This vulnerability allows for an attacker to bypass the IIS configuration that specifies which type of authentication is allowed, but not the file system-based ACL check that verifies whether a file is accessible by a given user. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability would still restrict the attacker to the permissions granted to the anonymous user account on the file system ACL level. Therefore this vulnerability cannot be used to exceed the level of access granted to the anonymous user account through file system ACLs. The default anonymous user account is configured as the IUSR\_<computername> account.

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 5.0 and 7.0 are not affected by this vulnerability.  
-   **WebDAV is not enabled by default on IIS 6.0**. On IIS 6.0 running on Windows Server 2003 systems, WebDAV is not enabled in the default configuration. Unless WebDAV has been enabled by an administrator on these systems, the vulnerability is not exposed.  
-   **The anonymous user account is denied write access by default**. In order to successfully exploit this vulnerability with write access, the anonymous user account would need to have write access ACLs set within the IIS folder structure. However, by default, the anonymous user account only has read access ACLs set. On IIS 6.0, there is an explicit deny ACE for the default anonymous user account.
