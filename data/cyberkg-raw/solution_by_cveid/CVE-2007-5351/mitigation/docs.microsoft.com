#### Mitigating Factors for SMBv2 Signing Vulnerability - CVE-2007-5351
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   SMB signing is off by default in Windows Vista, which means that a computer running Microsoft Vista wonâ€™t use it unless it connects to another host which requires it.  
-   When a previous operating system version is part of the communications, SMBv2 will not be used. For example, Windows Vista would use SMB to communicate with Windows XP, rather than SMBv2.  
-   Customers using SMBv1 are not affected by this vulnerability.
