#### Mitigating Factors for SMB Credential Reflection Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4037
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. In this case, the SMB port should be blocked from the Internet.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.  
-   All supported editions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 have file sharing disabled by default, which reduces the exposure of these platforms to this vulnerability. This default configuration, which is a change from earlier platforms, results in a reduced attack surface for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, and recategorizes the severity rating for these platforms to Moderate for this vulnerability.
