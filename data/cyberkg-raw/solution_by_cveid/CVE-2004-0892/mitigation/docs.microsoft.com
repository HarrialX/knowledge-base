Mitigating Factors for Spoofing Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0892:

This vulnerability would not allow an attacker to spoof an SSL certificate. An attacker would not be able to successfully use SSL certificates that belong to other domain names. For example, a spoofed Web site cannot use a trusted Web site’s SSL certificate to establish an SSL session with a user. If a spoofed Web site tries to do this, authentication fails and the user receives a warning message.
An attacker would first have to persuade a user view content that causes a reverse lookup to occur. For example, an attacker could persuade a user to visit the attacker’s Web site by using an IP address that would cause a reverse lookup to occur.
Systems that enable the default Site and Content rule permitting “All traffic” to “All Destinations” are not affected by this vulnerability. However this rule is generally disabled as a security best practice guideline and we do not recommend enabling to help mitigate this issue vulnerability.
