Mitigating Factors for ICMP Connection Reset Vulnerability - CVE-2004-0790:

Firewall best practices and firewall or router configurations that block all ICMP traffic can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
IPv6 support is not installed by default on Windows XP Service Pack 1, Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1.
An attacker’s system must belong to the same IPv6 network as the target system.
An attacker must first predict or discover the IP address and port information of the source and of the destination of an existing TCP network connection.
This attack would have to be performed on each TCP connection that was targeted for reset. Many applications will automatically restore connections that have been reset.

Mitigating Factors for TCP Connection Reset Vulnerability - CVE-2004-0230:

An attacker must be able to predict or discover the IP address and port information of the source and of the destination of an existing TCP network connection. An attacker would also have to predict or to learn certain difficult TCP network packet details. Protocols or programs that maintain long sessions and have predictable TCP/IP information are at an increased risk for this issue.
IPv6 support is not installed by default on Windows XP Service Pack 1 and Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1.
An attacker’s system must belong to the same IPv6 network as the target system.
Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. Affected systems that allow any TCP connections to the Internet may be vulnerable to this issue.
This attack would have to be performed on each TCP connection that was targeted for reset. Many applications will automatically restore connections that have been reset.

Mitigating Factors for Spoofed Connection Request Vulnerability - CVE-2005-0688:

IPv6 support is not installed by default on Windows XP Service Pack 1, Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1.
An attacker’s system must belong to the same IPv6 network as the target system.
The affected system return to a normal operational state after the specially crafted packets are finished processing.
A typical network deployment scenario would limit the attack to an individual network segment as most routers will not forward these kinds of specially crafted TCP/IP network packets.
Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. Affected systems that allow any IP connections to the Internet may be vulnerable to this issue.
