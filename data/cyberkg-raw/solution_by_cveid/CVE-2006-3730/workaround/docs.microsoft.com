Workarounds for Windows Shell Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3730:

Prevent the WebViewFolderIcon ActiveX object from running in Internet Explorer.
You can disable attempts to instantiate an ActiveX control in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797. Follow these steps in this article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.
To set the kill bits for CLSIDs with values of {e5df9d10-3b52-11d1-83e8-00a0c90dc849} and {844F4806-E8A8-11d2-9652-00C04FC30871}, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{e5df9d10-3b52-11d1-83e8-00a0c90dc849}]
"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{844F4806-E8A8-11d2-9652-00C04FC30871}]
"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400
You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:
Group Policy Collection
What is Group Policy Object Editor
Core Group Policy Tools and Settings
Note You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.
Note The compatibility flag for CLSID {e5df9d10-3b52-11d1-83e8-00a0c90dc849} has an original DWORD value of 0x20000. If you deploy this workaround you should reset the DWORD value to 0x20000 rather than delete the key after you have installed the security update. For more information of various values that determine the behavior of registered Microsoft ActiveX controls see the following product documentation.
Impact of Workaround: Web sites that use the WebViewFolderIcon ActiveX Control may no longer display or function correctly.

Set Internet and Local Intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in these zones,
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your security browser to High.
To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click Internet Options.
In the Internet Options dialog box, click the Security tab, and then click the Internet icon.
Under Security level for that zone, move the slider to High. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

Note If no slider is visible, click Default Level, and then move the slider to High.
Note Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the high security setting.
Impact of Workaround: There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click Yes to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the “Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites” workaround.

Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running ActiveX controls or disable ActiveX controls in the Internet and local intranet security zone.
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls only. To do this, follow these steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the Tools menu.
Click the Security tab.
Click Internet, and then click Custom Level.
Under Settings, in the ActiveX controls and plug-ins section, under Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins, click Prompt.
In the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click Prompt and then click OK.
Click Local intranet and then click Custom Level.
Under Settings, in the ActiveX controls and plug-ins section, under Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins, click Prompt.
In the Scripting section under Active Scripting, click Prompt.
Click OK two times to return to Internet Explorer.

For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements.

For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click Yes to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the “Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites” workaround.

Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites
After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer’s Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.
To do this, follow these steps:

In Internet Explorer, click the Tools menu, click Internet Options, and then click the Security tab.
In the Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings box, click Trusted Sites and then click Sites.
If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone check box.
In the Add this Web site to the zone box, type the URL of a site that you trust and then click Add.
Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
Click OK two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. One in particular that you may want to add is “*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com” (without the quotation marks). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX control to install the update.
