Mitigating Factors for Windows Media Player Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0006:

Windows Media Player is not the default handler for .bmp files.
When using Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 with Windows Media Player 7.1 or Windows XP Service Pack 1 with Windows Media Player 8, users are not vulnerable in a Web-based attack. Users are still vulnerable if a user downloads and installs a malicious Windows Media Player Skin.
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. It could also be possible to display malicious Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.
In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted file to the user and by persuading the user to open the file. Windows Media Player is not the default handler for .bmp files. In order for the exploit to take place, the user would have to save the .bmp file to the desktop and open it using Windows Media Player.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.
