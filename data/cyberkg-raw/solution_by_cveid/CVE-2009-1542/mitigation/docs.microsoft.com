#### Mitigating Factors for Virtual PC and Virtual Server Privileged Instruction Decoding Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1542
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   An attacker must be authenticated and logged in to the guest operating system running in the virtual machine in order to exploit this vulnerability.  
-   Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V is not affected by this vulnerability.  
-   Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP Mode on Windows 7 are not affected by this vulnerability.  
-   Deployments using Hardware Assisted Virtualization (HAV) are not affected by this vulnerability. HAV is supported by Virtual PC 2007 and Virtual Server 2005 R2 SP1, but on these versions HAV needs to be explicitly enabled.
