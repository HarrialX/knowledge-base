#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Active Directory Remote Code Execution Vulnerability- CVE-2007-0040
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   For customers who require the affected component, firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.  
-   Attacks attempting to exploit this vulnerability would most likely result in a denial of service condition. However remote code execution could be possible.  
-   On Windows Server 2003 an attacker must have valid logon credentials to exploit this vulnerability; the vulnerability can not be exploited by an anonymous user.
