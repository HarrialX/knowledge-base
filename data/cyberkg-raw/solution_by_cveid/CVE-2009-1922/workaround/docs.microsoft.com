#### Workarounds for MSMQ Null Pointer Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1922
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Disable the Message Queuing Service:**
  
    -   Interactively  
        Disabling the Message Queuing service will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To disable the Message Queuing service, follow these steps:  
        1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**. Alternatively, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**.  
        2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**. Alternatively, click **Switch to Classic View** and then double-click **Administrative Tools**.  
        3. Double-click **Services**.  
        4. Double-click **Message Queuing**.  
        5. In the **Startup type** list, click **Disabled**.  
        6. Click **Stop**, and then click **OK**.  
    -   By Group Policy:  
        Disable the Message Queuing service by using the Group Policy settings. You can disable the startup of this service at either the local, site, domain, or organizational-unit level by using Group Policy object functionality in Microsoft Windows 2000 domain environments or in Windows Server 2003 domain environments.  
        **Note:** You may also review the Windows Server 2003 Security Guide. This guide includes information about how to disable services.

    You can also stop and disable the MSMQ service by using the following command at the command prompt (available in Windows XP and in the Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource Kit):
  
    `Sc stop MSMQ & sc config MSMQ start= disabled`
  
    **How to undo the workaround:** Use the steps above to set the Startup Type to **Automatic** and start the service.
