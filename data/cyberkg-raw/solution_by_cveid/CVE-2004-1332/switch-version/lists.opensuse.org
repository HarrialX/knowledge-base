The original advisory from iDEFENSE listed patches for specific versions of HP-UX.  On December 23, 2004, HP re-issued advisory HPSBUX0107-162 (originally published in 2001) stating that the fixes listed in the advisory correct this issue.  However, the patch numbers listed in the advisory are different than what was included in the iDEFENSE report.
