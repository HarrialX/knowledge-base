#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Kernel Metadata Parsing DOS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1971
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In a network-share-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted file on a network share that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site or network share. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to do so, typically by convincing them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message.
