Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

#### Mitigating Factors for Print Spooler Load Library Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0230
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.  
-   Only authenticated users can trigger this vulnerability. This vulnerability can only be triggered if the user can authenticate against the remote system. However, if the Guest account is enabled, then guest users can trigger this vulnerability as well.  
-   On all versions of Microsoft Windows, the attacker needs the "Manage Printer" privilege to exploit this vulnerability. On Microsoft Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the local user is automatically given this permission when installing a local printer. This can be accomplished without administrative privileges if the printer driver is included by default.
