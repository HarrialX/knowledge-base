#### Workarounds for Collaboration Data Objects Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1987:
  
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.
  
-   **Disable all event sinks that are enabled on Exchange 2000 Server and on servers that are running IIS:**
  
    Disabling all event sinks will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To disable the any custom or third-party event sinks, follow these steps:
  
    1.  Use the **cscript.exe smtpreg.vbs /enum** command-line command to enumerate all the registered event sinks. Examine the output of this command and look for custom or non-Microsoft software event sink entries.  
    2.  After you identify the event sink that you want to disable, run the following command at a command prompt:  
        **cscript.exe smtpreg.vbs /disable**
  
    **Impact of Workaround:** The custom or third-party application that has created the event sink in the SMTP service will not work correctly until the event sink is re-enabled.
  
-   **Unregister the Cdoex.dll file and the Cdosys.dll file on Exchange 2000 Server and unregister the Cdosys.dll file on servers that are running IIS:**
  
    Unregistering the Cdoex.dll file and the Cdosys.dll file helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.
  
    To disable the Cdoex.dll file and the Cdosys.dll file for Exchange 2000 Server, follow these steps.  
    **Important** You must follow these steps in the following order.
  
    1.  Run the following command at a command prompt:  
        **Regsvr32.exe “C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\CDO\\cdoex.dll” /u**  
    2.  Run the following command at a command prompt:  
        **Regsvr32.exe %windir%\\system32\\cdosys.dll /u**
  
    To disable the Cdosys.dll file for servers that are running IIS, type the following command at a command prompt:
  
    1.  **Regsvr32.exe %windir%\\system32\\cdosys.dll /u**
  
    **Impact of Workaround:** Unregistering COM objects breaks programs that depend on the Cdosys.dll file or the Cdoex.dll file.
