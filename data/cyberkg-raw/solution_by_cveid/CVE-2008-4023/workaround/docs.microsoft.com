#### Workarounds for Active Directory Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4023
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Block TCP ports 389 and 636 at the perimeter firewall**  
    These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking it at the enterprise firewall, both inbound and outbound, will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312). For more information about the Windows Firewall, see [How to Configure Windows Firewall on a Single Computer](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/smallbusiness/prodtech/windowsxp/cfgfwall.mspx).
