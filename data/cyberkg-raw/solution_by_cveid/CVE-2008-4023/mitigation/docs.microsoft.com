#### Mitigating Factors for Active Directory Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4023
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   For customers who require the affected component, firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.  
-   This vulnerability only affects Microsoft Windows 2000 servers configured to be domain controllers. If a Microsoft Windows 2000 server has not been promoted to a domain controller, it will not be listening to LDAP or LDAPS queries, and will not be exposed to this vulnerability.  
    To confirm whether a server is listening to LDAP or LDAPS queries, run the following command from an administrator command prompt and look to see if it is listening on the LDAP port (389) or the LDAPS port (636):
  
    `netstat â€“a`
  
    LDAP is enabled if the results contain the following:
  
    `Proto Local Address Foreign Address StateTCP 0.0.0.0:389 0.0.0.0:0 LISTENINGTCP 0.0.0.0:636 0.0.0.0:0 LISTENING`
