Mitigating Factors for Parameter Validation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4258
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s Web site.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps mitigate attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.
Internet Explorer 7 is not affected by this vulnerability.


Mitigating Factors for HTML Objects Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4259
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 is not affected by this vulnerability.

Mitigating Factors for HTML Rendering Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4261

Windows XP Service Pack 2 introduced a security enhancement known as the Local Machine Zone Lockdown. This security enhancement mitigates this vulnerability when the Local Machine Zone is the target of an attack. This feature restricts HTML in the Local Machine zone. This feature also restricts HTML that is hosted in Internet Explorer. These restrictions help mitigate attacks where the Local Machine zone is used as an attack vector to load malicious HTML code. Because of this change, ActiveX script in local HTML pages that are viewed inside Internet Explorer will not run. Also, script in local HTML pages that is viewed inside Internet Explorer prompts the user for permission to run.
Internet Explorer 7 is not affected by this vulnerability.
