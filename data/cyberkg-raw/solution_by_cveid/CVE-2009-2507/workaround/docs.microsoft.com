#### Workarounds for Memory Corruption in Indexing Service Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2507
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Unregister ixsso.dll**
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **"%SystemRoot%\\System32\\regsvr32.exe" /u ixsso.dll**, and then click **OK**.  
    2.  A dialog box appears to confirm that the un-registration process has succeeded. Click **OK** to close the dialog box.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** The Windows Indexing Service will not be able to construct an indexed catalog to facilitate efficient and rapid searching. Searches may take longer to complete.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **"%SystemRoot%\\System32\\regsvr32.exe" ixsso.dll**, and then click **OK**.  
    2.  A dialog box appears to confirm that the registration process has succeeded. Click **OK** to close the dialog box.
  
-   **Prevent the Indexing Service ActiveX control COM object from running in Internet Explorer**
  
    You can disable attempts to instantiate the Indexing Service ActiveX control COM object in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.
  
    **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
  
    For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow these steps in this article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.
  
    To set the kill bit for the Indexing Service ActiveX control which has a CLSID value of {A4463024-2B6F-11D0-BFBC-0020F8008024}, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.
  
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
    \[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{A4463024-2B6F-11D0-BFBC-0020F8008024}\]  
    "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400
  
    You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:

    **Note** You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.
  
    **Impact of Workaround**: Internet Explorer will no longer be able to invoke the Indexing Service ActiveX control.
  
-   **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**
  
    You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.
  
    To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:
  
    1.  On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.  
    2.  In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.  
    3.  Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.
  
    **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.
  
    **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".
  
    **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**
  
    After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.
  
    To do this, follow these steps:
  
    1.  In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.  
    2.  In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.  
    3.  If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.  
    4.  In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.  
    5.  Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.  
    6.  Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.
  
    **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
  
-   **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**
  
    You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:
  
    1.  In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.  
    2.  Click the **Security** tab.  
    3.  Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.  
    4.  Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.  
    5.  Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.  
    6.  Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.  
    7.  Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.
  
    **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.
  
    **Impact of workaround.**Â There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality.
