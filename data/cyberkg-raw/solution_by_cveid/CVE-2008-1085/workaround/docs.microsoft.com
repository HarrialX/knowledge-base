#### Workarounds for Data Stream Handling Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1085
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Read e-mail messages in plain text format to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector**
  
    You can help protect yourself against this vulnerability by changing your e-mail settings to read e-mail messages in plain text using Outlook 2002 and later, Outlook Express 6 and later, or Windows Mail. For information in Outlook, search “plain text” in Help and review “Read messages in plain text.” In Outlook Express, search “plain text” in Help and review “Reducing your risk of getting e-mail viruses.” In Windows Mail, search “plain text” in Help and review “Security and privacy in Windows Mail.”
  
    **Impact of workaround.** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:
  
    -   The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.  
    -   Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.  
    -   Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.
