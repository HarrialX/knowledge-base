Mitigating Factors for Hyperlink Object Library Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0057:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could also attempt to compromise a Web site to have it display a Web page with malicious content. An attacker would have no way to force users to click on the malicious link. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must click on a link within an e-mail message.
Customers running Microsoft ISA 2004 as their web proxy are at less risk from this vulnerability, as ISA 2004 rejects the URL in question when handling proxy client requests if any “Request URL” based HTTP Filter Signature definition exists.
