Mitigating Factors for License Logging Service Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0050:

On Windows Server 2003 the License Logging service is disabled by default. Typically only administrators can change the startup type of a service. An attacker would first have to change the startup type from Disabled, and then start the service to try to exploit this vulnerability.
If the License Logging service is manually started on Windows Server 2003, attempts to exploit this vulnerability could cause in a denial of service for the affected service. This vulnerability does not allow remote code execution on Windows Server 2003.
On Small Business Server 2000 and on Windows Small Business Server 2003, the License Logging service is installed and running. However, by default, on Windows Small Business Server 2003 and earlier, the License Logging service communication ports are blocked from the Internet and the License Logging service is available only on the local network.
On Windows 2000 Server Service Pack 4 and Windows Server 2003, only authenticated users or programs can establish a connection to the License Logging service. However, this does not apply to installations of Windows 2000 Server where Service Pack 4 has been ‘slipstreamed’ into the operating system directory. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 896589.
Disabling the License Logging service helps prevent the possibility of a remote attack. Customers that have disabled this service would be at a reduced risk to attack from this vulnerability. See the “Workarounds” section for instructions that describe how to disable this service. By default, affected operating systems other than Windows Server 2003 have the License Logging service startup type set to Automatic instead of Disabled.
Chapter 6 of Microsoft Solution for Securing Windows 2000 Server, Hardening the Base Windows 2000 Server recommends disabling the License Logging service. Environments that comply with these guidelines could be at a reduced risk from this vulnerability.
Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
