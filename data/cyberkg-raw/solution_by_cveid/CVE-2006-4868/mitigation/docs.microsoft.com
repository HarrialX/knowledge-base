Mitigating Factors for VML Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4868:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or instant messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
In an e-mail based attack of this exploit, customers who read e-mail in plain text are at less risk from this vulnerability. Instead users would have to either click on a link that would take them to a malicious Web site or open an attachment to be at risk from this vulnerability.
In an e-mail based attack of this exploit, customers who read e-mail using Outlook Express on Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, are at less risk from this vulnerability because Binary and Script Behaviors is disabled by default in the Restricted sites zone.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode mitigates this vulnerability in Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 because Binary and Script Behaviors is disabled by default in the Internet zone.
By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode mitigates this vulnerability in the e-mail vector for Outlook Express because reading e-mail messages in plain text is the default configuration. See the FAQ section of this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
