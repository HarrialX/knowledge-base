#### Workarounds for Reference Counter Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2011-2013
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Block unused UDP ports at the perimeter firewall**
  
    Blocking unused (closed) UDP ports at the perimeter firewall helps protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
