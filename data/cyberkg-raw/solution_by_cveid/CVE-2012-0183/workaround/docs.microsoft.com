#### Workarounds for RTF Mismatch Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0183
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Read emails in plain text**
  
    To help protect yourself from the email attack vector, read email messages in plain text format.
  
    Microsoft Outlook 2003, Microsoft Outlook 2007, and Microsoft Outlook 2010 provide an option for reading email messages in plain text format. For more information about the **Read all standard mail in plain text** option, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 831607](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/831607).
  
    Microsoft Office Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1, Office XP Service Pack 2, or Office XP Service Pack 3 can enable this setting and view in plain text only those email messages that are not digitally signed or email messages that are not encrypted. Digitally signed email messages or encrypted email messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Email messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. In addition, the following behavior may be experienced:
  
    -   The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.  
    -   Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.  
    -   Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.
  
-   **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of RTF documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations**
  
    The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.
          
    **Note** Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.
  
    **For Office 2003** 
  
    ```
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]
    "RtfFiles"=dword:00000001
    ```
          
    **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2003, all of the latest security updates for Microsoft Office 2003 must be applied.
  
    **For Office 2007** 
  
    ```
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]
    "RtfFiles"=dword:00000001
    ```
          
    **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2007, all of the latest security updates for Microsoft Office 2007 must be applied.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special exempt directory or have not moved files to a trusted location as discussed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922848) will be unable to open RTF files in Office 2003 or 2007 Microsoft Office System.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    For Office 2003
  
    ```
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]
    "RtfFiles"=dword:00000000
    ```
  
    For Office 2007
  
    ```
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]
    "RtfFiles"=dword:00000000
    ```
