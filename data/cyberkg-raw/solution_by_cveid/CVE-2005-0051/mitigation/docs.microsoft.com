Mitigating Factors for Named Pipe Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0051:

Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
Stopping or disabling the Computer Browser service and then restarting the affected system mitigates this vulnerability. The information disclosure does not happen if this service is stopped or disabled. By default, the Computer Browser service is not running on Windows XP Service Pack 2. Windows XP Service Pack 2 systems that are members of a domain have the Computer Browser disabled. By default, on Windows XP Service Pack 2 systems, that are not members of a domain, the Windows Firewall is enabled and the Computer Browser does not start. If the Windows Firewall is disabled or if File and Printer sharing is enabled, the Computer Browser service will start successfully and the system could be vulnerable to this issue.
