Mitigating Factors for Server Message Block Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0045:

Network-based attacks using broadcast packets would typically be limited to the local subnet because most routers do not forward broadcast packets.
Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. By default, the Windows Firewall that is provided as part of Windows XP Service Pack 2 blocks the affected ports from responding to network based attempts to exploit this vulnerability. However, Windows XP Service Pack 2 would still vulnerable to the Web-based attack scenarios.
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could also attempt to compromise a Web site to have it display a Web page with malicious content. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or to a site that has been compromised by the attacker.
The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must click a link that is sent in an e-mail message.
