#### Mitigating Factors for Kodak image Viewer Remote Code Execution Vulnerability – CVE-2007-2217
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   Systems running Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 are only vulnerable if they were upgraded from Windows 2000.  
-   When ‘Use Windows Classic Folders’ is enabled for viewing files, users are protected from shell-based attacks  
-   Office 2003 installs an image viewer application that takes over the file association, and is not vulnerable to this vulnerability.  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
