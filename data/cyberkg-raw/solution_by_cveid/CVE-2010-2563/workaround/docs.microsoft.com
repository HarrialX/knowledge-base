#### Workarounds for WordPad Word 97 Text Converter Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2563
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   Disable the WordPad Word 97 text converter by restricting access to the converter file.
  
    An administrator can apply an access control list to affected converters to ensure that the converter is no longer loaded by WordPad. This effectively prevents exploitation of the issue using this attack vector.
  
    **Warning** Undo this workaround before installing this security update.
  
    In order to apply the access list, log on as administrator and run the following commands from the command prompt.
  
    **Note** Some of these commands may result in an error message; this is expected if the file you are trying to change permissions for does not exist.
  
    ```
    echo y| cacls "%ProgramFiles%\Windows NT\Accessories\mswrd8.wpc" /E /P everyone:N
    echo y| cacls "%ProgramFiles%\Windows NT\Accessories\mswrd864.wpc" /E /P everyone:N
    echo y| cacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Windows NT\Accessories\mswrd8.wpc" /E /P everyone:N
    ```
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Upon implementing the workaround, opening a Word document in WordPad results in WordPad displaying representations of binary data instead of formatted text.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.** Log on as administrator and run the following commands from the command prompt.
  
    **Note** Depending on your operating system version and your history of operating system upgrades and service packs, some of the files referenced below may not exist; this is expected.
  
    ```
    echo y| cacls "%ProgramFiles%\Windows NT\Accessories\mswrd8.wpc" /E /R everyone
    echo y| cacls "%ProgramFiles%\Windows NT\Accessories\mswrd864.wpc" /E /R everyone
    echo y| cacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Windows NT\Accessories\mswrd8.wpc" /E /R everyone
    ```
