Mitigating Factors for SMB Pathname Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0020
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

In Windows Vista and Windows 7, if the network profile is set to "Public", the system is not affected by this vulnerability since unsolicited inbound network packets are blocked by default.
Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. In this case, the SMB ports should be blocked from the Internet.
An attacker must have valid logon credentials to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited by anonymous users.
