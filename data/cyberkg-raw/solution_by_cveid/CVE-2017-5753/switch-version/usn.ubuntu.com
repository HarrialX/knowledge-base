Update instructions
The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:
Ubuntu 14.04


linux-image-3.13.0-141-generic
              
              -
              
                3.13.0-141.190






linux-image-3.13.0-141-lowlatency
              
              -
              
                3.13.0-141.190






linux-image-generic
              
              -
              
                3.13.0.141.151






linux-image-lowlatency

                3.13.0.141.151






Please note that fully mitigating CVE-2017-5715 (Spectre Variant 2)
requires corresponding processor microcode/firmware updates or,
in virtual environments, hypervisor updates. On i386 and amd64
architectures, the IBRS and IBPB features are required to enable the
kernel mitigations. Ubuntu is working with Intel and AMD to provide
future microcode updates that implement IBRS and IBPB as they are made
available. Ubuntu users with a processor from a different vendor should
contact the vendor to identify necessary firmware updates. Ubuntu
will provide corresponding QEMU updates in the future for users of
self-hosted virtual environments in coordination with upstream QEMU.
Ubuntu users in cloud environments should contact the cloud provider
to confirm that the hypervisor has been updated to expose the new
CPU features to virtual machines.
After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to
apply the necessary changes.
