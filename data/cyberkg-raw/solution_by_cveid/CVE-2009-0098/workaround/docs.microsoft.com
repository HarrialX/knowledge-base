Workarounds for Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0098
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Block MS-TNEF on Microsoft Exchange Server to help protect against attempts to exploit this vulnerability through SMTP e-mail
Blocking the application/ms-tnef MIME content type, could help protect Exchange servers and other affected programs from attempts to exploit this vulnerability if customers cannot install the available security update.
Systems can be configured to block certain types of files from being received as e-mail attachments. Microsoft TNEF-encoded e-mail messages, commonly known as rich text format (RTF) e-mail messages, can contain malicious OLE objects. These e-mail messages contain a file attachment that stores the TNEF information. This file attachment is usually named Winmail.dat. Blocking this file, and blocking the ms-tnef MIME type, could help protect Exchange servers and other affected programs from attempts to exploit this vulnerability if customers cannot install the available security update. To help protect an Exchange Server computer from attacks through SMTP, block the Winmail.dat file and all application/ms-tnef MIME type content before it reaches the Exchange Server computer.
Note You cannot mitigate this vulnerability by setting the Exchange rich-text format option in Exchange Server to Never used or by disabling TNEF processing by editing the registry.
Note Exchange supports other messaging protocols, such as X.400, that these workarounds do not protect. We recommend that administrators require authentication on all other client and message transport protocols to help prevent attacks using these protocols.
Note Filtering only for attachments that have the file name Winmail.dat may not be sufficient to help protect your system. A malicious file attachment could be given another file name that could then be processed by the Exchange Server computer. To help protect against malicious e-mail messageâ€™s, block all application/ms-tnef MIME type content.
There are many ways to block the Winmail.dat file and other TNEF content. Here are some suggestions:

You can use ISA Server 2000 SMTP Message Screener to block all file attachments or to block only the Winmail.dat file. Blocking all file attachments provides the most protection for this issue if you use ISA Server 2000 because ISA Server 2000 does not support blocking content based on MIME content types. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 315132.
You can use ISA Server 2000 SMTP Filter to block all file attachments or to block only the Winmail.dat file. Blocking all file attachments provides the most protection for this issue if you use ISA Server 2000 because ISA Server 2000 does not support blocking content based on MIME content types. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 320703.
You can use ISA Server 2004 SMTP Filter and Message Screener block all file attachments or just the Winmail.dat file. Blocking all file attachments provides the most protection for this issue if you use ISA Server 2004 because ISA Server 2004 does not support blocking content based on MIME content types. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 888709.
You can use attachment filtering in Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 to apply filters at the server level to control the attachments that users receive. See Attachment Filtering for more information.
You can use third-party e-mail filters to block all application/ms-tnef MIME type content before it is sent to the Exchange Server computer or to a vulnerable application.

Impact of workaround: If TNEF attachments are blocked, e-mail messages that are formatted as RTF will not be received correctly. In some cases, users could receive blank e-mail messages instead of the original RTF-formatted e-mail message. In other cases, users may not receive e-mail messages that are formatted as RTF at all. Blocking the TNEF attachments will not affect e-mail messages that are formatted as HTML or that are formatted as plain text.
