Workarounds for PowerPoint Parsing Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2572
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Restrict access to pp7x32.dll for users of Microsoft PowerPoint 2002
Note You will need administrator privileges to set these file restrictions.
Windows XP and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition
For PowerPoint 2002 on Windows XP, run the following commands from a command prompt as an administrator:
cacls "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office10\Xlators\PP7X32.DLL" /E /P everyone:N

For PowerPoint 2002 on Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, run the following commands from a command prompt as an administrator:
cacls "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office10\Xlators\PP7X32.DLL" /E /P everyone:N

For PowerPoint 2002 on 32-bit editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:
takeown /f "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office10\Xlators\PP7X32.DLL"

icacls "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office10\Xlators\PP7X32.DLL" /save %TEMP%\PP7X32_ACL.TXT

icacls "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office10\Xlators\PP7X32.DLL" /deny everyone:(F)

For PowerPoint 2002 on 64-bit editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:
takeown /f "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office (x86)\Office10\Xlators\PP7X32.DLL"

icacls "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office10\Xlators\PP7X32.DLL /save %TEMP%\PP7X32_ACL.TXT"

icacls "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office10\Xlators\PP7X32.DLL" /deny everyone:(F)

Impact of Workaround. You will not be able to open PowerPoint 95 formatted files.

Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations
The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.
Note Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.
For Office 2003 
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileOpenBlock]

"BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001

Note In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2003, all of the latest security updates for Microsoft Office 2003 must be applied.
Alternatively, file block can be applied using Group Policy. For more information, see the TechNet article, Plan file block settings for Office 2010.
Impact of workaround. For Microsoft Office 2003 and Microsoft Office 2007, users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special "exempt directory" as discussed in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848 will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions. For Microsoft Office 2007, Office 2003 or earlier versions will either be blocked from opening or will be opened in protected mode depending on the open behavior that was selected.
How to undo the workaround.
For Office 2003
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileOpenBlock]

"BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000


Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources
The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) helps protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.
To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or Office 2007 installed.
To install MOICE, you must also have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the Microsoft Download Center.
MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit Microsoft Update to install all recommended updates.
Enable MOICE
Note See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865 to use the automated Microsoft Fix it solution to enable or disable this workaround.
To manually enable MOICE, run the commands as specified in the following table. Running the commands will associate the Office application extensions with MOICE.


 



Command to enable MOICE to be the registered handler




For Word, run the following command from a command prompt:
ASSOC .doc=oice.word.document


For Excel, run the following commands from a command prompt:
ASSOC .XLS=oice.excel.sheet
ASSOC .XLT=oice.excel.template
ASSOC .XLA=oice.excel.addin


For PowerPoint, run the following commands from a command prompt:
ASSOC .PPT=oice.powerpoint.show
ASSOC .POT=oice.powerpoint.template
ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow



Note On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, run the above commands from an elevated command prompt.
For more information on MOICE, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865.
Impact of workaround. Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the Microsoft Office 2007 Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.
How to undo the workaround. Run the commands to disable MOICE as specified in the table below.
 



Command to disable MOICE as the registered handler




For Word, run the following command from a command prompt:
ASSOC .doc=Word.Document.8


For Excel, run the following commands from a command prompt:
ASSOC .xls=Excel.Sheet.8
ASSOC .xlt=Excel.Template
ASSOC .xla=Excel.Addin


For PowerPoint, run the following commands from a command prompt:
ASSOC .ppt=PowerPoint.Show.8
ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow
ASSOC .pps=PowerPoint.SlideShow.8



Note On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, run the above commands from an elevated command prompt.

Do not open PowerPoint files from untrusted sources
Do not open or save PowerPoint files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.
