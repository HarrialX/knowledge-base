Mitigating Factors for JView Profiler Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2087:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

The Microsoft Java Virtual Machine is not included in the following software by default:

Windows XP Service Pack 1a and Windows XP Service Pack 2
Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1

However, the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine may have been installed by an application. It could also be present as a result of upgrading the operating system. Customers can use the MSJVM Diagnostic Tool, which is available from the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine Support page. Customers can use this tool to perform remote and local scans to detect for the presence of MSJVM and MSJVM-related software. See the “How do I know if I have the Javaprxy.dll on my system?” question in the FAQ section of this document for more information.

The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail. However, if a user clicks on a link within an e-mail they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario described previously.
