Mitigating Factors for FTP Client Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2126:

If an attacker successfully persuades users to visit an FTP server hosting files with specially-crafted file names, the attacker would have no way of forcing files to be transferred. User interaction is required before the file can be transferred to the affected system.
If the malicious FTP transfer tries to overwrite an existing file on the affected system, the user receives an “Overwrite File” warning message. The file is saved only if the user selects to allow it to save when they receive the warning message.
