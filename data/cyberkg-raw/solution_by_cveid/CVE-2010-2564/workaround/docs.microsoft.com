#### Workarounds for Movie Maker Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2564
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Remove the Movie Maker .MSWMM file association**
  
    **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 981997](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/981997) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround. This Fix it solution deploys the workaround, and thus has the same user impact. We recommend that administrators review the KB article closely prior to deploying this Fix it solution.
  
    **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys and Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
  
    **Note** We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.
  
    To remove the Movie Maker .MSWMM file association, follow these steps:
  
    **Interactive Method**
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **regedit**, and then click **OK**.  
    2.  Expand **HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT**, click on **.MSWMM**, and then click the **File** menu and select **Export**.  
    3.  In the **Export Registry File** dialog box, type **MSWMM file association registry backup.reg** and click **Save**. This will create a backup of this registry key in the 'My Documents' folder by default.  
    4.  Press the **Delete** key on the keyboard to delete the registry key. When prompted to delete the registry value, click **Yes**.
  
    **Managed Deployment Script**
  
    1.  Make a backup copy of the registry key using the following command:  
        `Regedit.exe /e MSWMM_registry_backup.reg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.MSWMM`  
    2.  Save the following to a file with a .REG extension (i.e., Delete\_MSWMM\_file\_association.reg):  
        `Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00`  
        
        `[-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.MSWMM]`  
    3.  Run the registry script created in step 2 on the target machine with the following command:  
        `Regedit.exe /s Delete_MSWMM_file_association.reg`
  
    **Impact of workaround.** This workaround removes the .MSWMM file association. Double-clicking an MSWMM file will no longer launch Windows Movie Maker.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.** Restore the registry key by using Regedit to restore the settings saved in the .REG file.
