#### Workarounds for Windows Media Player Code Execution Vulnerability Parsing Skins – CVE-2007-3037
  
**Disassociate the WMZ and WMD file extensions**
  
Disassociation of WMZ and WMD in Windows prevents previewing or opening WMZ and WMD files in Windows Media Player.
  
1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **"regedit”** (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.  
2.  Expand **HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT**, and click .**WMZ**, and then right click and select **Export**. Note: This will create a backup of this registry key in the ‘My Documents’ folder by default.  
3.  In the **Export Registry File** window, type “WMZ file association registry backup.reg” and press **Save**.  
    This will create a backup of this registry key in the “My Documents” folder by default.  
4.  Press the **Delete** key on the keyboard to delete the registry key. Select **Yes** to confirm the registry key deletion.  
5.  Repeat steps 2-5 for the **WMD**key.
  
**Impact of Workaround**: This workaround prevents users from applying skin files to Windows Media Player by double clicking on them. Users can still apply skin files that are in their default ‘skins’ directory.
  
**Un-register Wmp.dll**
  
1.  Un-registering the Wmp.dll registry key helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To modify the Wmp.dll registry key, follow these steps.  
2.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **"regsvr32 -u %windir%\\system32\\wmp.dll"** (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.  
3.  When a dialog box appears that confirms that the process has been successful, click **OK**.  
4.  Select the **File Types** tab.
  
**Impact of Workaround**: This workaround disables the Windows Media Player and applications that use the embedded Windows Media ActiveX Control.
