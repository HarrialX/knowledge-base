#### Workarounds for ICMP Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1871
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Block ICMP at the firewall**
  
    Blocking all ICMP messages at the network boundary firewall or at the router will help protect systems that are behind that firewall or router from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet.
  
    **Impact of workaround.**Â This workaround can negatively impact performance by preventing TCP from optimizing network communication. ICMP network packets can eliminate fragmentation at routers connecting networks with different MTUs. Fragmentation reduces TCP throughput and increases network congestion.
  
#### Workarounds for TCP/IP QOS Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1965
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   Disable Policy-based QoS. For more information, see the Microsoft TechNet article, [Policy-based Quality of Service (QoS)](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd919203(ws.10).aspx).
