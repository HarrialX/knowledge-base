#### Mitigating Factors for Color Control Panel Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2010-5082
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   For an attack to be successful, a user must visit an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share and open a legitimate file (such as a .icm or .icc file).  
-   The file sharing protocol, Server Message Block (SMB), is often disabled on the perimeter firewall. This limits the potential attack vectors for this vulnerability.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
