#### Workarounds for OpenType Font Index Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3956
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Disable the Preview Pane and Details Pane in Windows Explorer**
  
    Disabling the Preview and Details panes in Windows Explorer prevents OTF fonts from being viewed in Windows Explorer. While this prevents malicious files from being viewed in Windows Explorer, it does not prevent a local, authenticated user from running a specially crafted program to exploit this vulnerability. To disable these panes in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, perform the following steps:
  
    1.  Open Windows Explorer, click **Organize**, and then click **Layout**.  
    2.  Clear both the **Details pane** and **Preview pane** menu options.  
    3.  Close all open instances of Windows Explorer for the change to take effect.
  
    **Impact of workaround.**  Windows Explorer will not display OTF fonts.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    To re-enable the Windows Explorer Preview and Details panes in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2:
  
    1.  Open Windows Explorer, click **Organize**, and then click **Layout**.  
    2.  Select both the **Details pane** and **Preview pane** menu options.  
    3.  Close all open instances of Windows Explorer for the change to take effect.
