Workarounds for Crystal Reports RPT Processing Vulnerability – CVE-2006-6133
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Remove the Crystal Reports for Visual Studio feature from Visual Studio
Removing the Crystal Reports for Visual Studio feature will prevent users from opening Crystal Reports files.

Use Add/Remove Programs

Click Start, click Control Panel, click Add/Remove Programs.
Find your installation of Visual Studio and select it.
Click Add/Remove Features.
Uncheck the box next to Crystal Reports for Visual Studio.
Click Update to remove the feature.


Use the original installation media

Insert the original installation CD for Visual Studio into your drive.
Wait for the setup menu to appear. Click Add/Remove Features.
Uncheck the box next to Crystal Reports for Visual Studio.
Click Update to remove the feature.



Impact of workaround: Crystal Reports files will not open.
How to undo the workaround: Add the Crystal Reports for Visual Studio component using the Add/Remove Programs menu and select the Crystal Reports for Visual Studio feature.

For affected editions of Visual Studio 2002 and Visual Studio 2003, unregister craxddrt20.dll
Administrators can help protect users by unregistering a key DLL file, which loads RPT files. This will prevent users from opening RPT files.

Log on as a user with administrator privileges.

Click Start, click Run, type cmd, and then click OK.

Type the following command at a command prompt:
regsvr32.exe –u "\Program Files\Common Files\Crystal Decisions\1.0\Bin\craxddrt20.dll"


Impact of workaround: Crystal Reports files will not open.
How to undo the workaround: Re-register craxddrt20.dll. Type the following command at a command prompt:
regsvr32.exe "\Program Files\Common Files\Crystal Decisions\1.0\Bin\craxddrt20.dll"

For affected editions of Visual Studio 2005, unregister craxddrt.dll
Administrators can help protect users by unregistering a key DLL file, which loads RPT files. This will prevent users from opening RPT files.

Log on as a user with administrator privileges.

Start, click Run, type cmd, and then click OK.

Type the following command at a command prompt:
regsvr32.exe –u "\Program Files\Common Files\Business Objects\2.7\Bin\craxddrt.dll"


Impact of workaround: Crystal Reports files will not open.
How to undo the workaround: Re-register craxddrt.dll. Type the following command at a command prompt:
regsvr32.exe "\Program Files\Common Files\Business Objects\2.7\Bin\craxddrt.dll"

For affected editions of Visual Studio .NET 2002 and Visual Studio .NET 2003, modify Access Control List on craxddrt20.dll
To modify the Access Control List (ACL) on craxddrt20 to be more restrictive, follow these steps:

Log on as a user with administrator privileges.

Click Start, click Run, type cmd, and then click OK.

Document the current ACLs that are on the file (including inheritance settings) for future reference in case you have to undo this modification. To view the ACLs, type the following:
cacls "\Program Files\Common Files\Crystal Decisions\1.0\Bin\craxddrt20.dll"

To deny the “everyone” group access to the file, type the following command at a command prompt:
cacls "\Program Files\Common Files\Crystal Decisions\1.0\Bin\craxddrt20.dll" /E /D Everyone


Impact of workaround: Crystal Reports files will not open.
How to undo the workaround: Type the following command at a command prompt:
cacls "\Program Files\Common Files\Crystal Decisions\1.0\Bin\craxddrt20.dll" /E /R Everyone

For affected editions of Visual Studio 2005, modify the Access Control List on craxddrt.dll
To modify the Access Control List (ACL) on craxddrt.dll to be more restrictive, follow these steps:

Log on as a user with administrator privileges.

Click Start, click Run, type cmd, and then click OK.

Document the current ACLs that are on the file (including inheritance settings) for future reference in case you have to undo this modification. To view the ACLs, type the following:
cacls "\Program Files\Common Files\Business Objects\2.7\Bin\craxddrt.dll"]

To deny the “everyone” group access to the file, type the following command at a command prompt:
cacls "\Program Files\Common Files\Business Objects\2.7\Bin\craxddrt.dll" /E /D Everyone


Impact of workaround: Crystal Reports files will not open.
How to undo the workaround: Type the following command at a command prompt:
cacls "\Program Files\Common Files\Business Objects\2.7\Bin\craxddrt.dll" /E /R Everyone
