#### Workarounds for DNS Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0006
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Clear the DNS cache periodically**
  
    Run the following dnscmd command as described in the article, [Dnscmd Syntax](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc756116(v=ws.10).aspx):
  
    `dnscmd [ServerName] /clearcache`
  
    This can be run as a scheduled task or as needed.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Clears the DNS cache memory of resource records in the specified DNS server.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.** 
  
    Delete or disable any scheduled task that is running the dnscmd command.
