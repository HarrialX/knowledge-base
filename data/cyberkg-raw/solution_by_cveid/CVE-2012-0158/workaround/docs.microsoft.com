Workarounds for MSCOMCTL.OCX RCE Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0158
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Donot open Microsoft Office and WordPad documents from untrusted sources
Do not open Microsoft Office or Rich Text Format (.rtf) files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

Prevent the vulnerableActiveX controls from being run in Internet Explorer
You can disable attempts to instantiate the MSCOMCTL.TreeView, MSCOMCTL.ListView2, MSCOMCTL.TreeView2, and MSCOMCTL.ListView controls in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the controls in the registry.
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797. Follow the steps in the article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.
To set the kill bit for the MSCOMCTL.TreeView, MSCOMCTL.ListView2, MSCOMCTL.TreeView2, and MSCOMCTL.ListView controls in the registry, follow these steps:

Create a text file named Disable_MSCOMCTL.reg with the following contents:
