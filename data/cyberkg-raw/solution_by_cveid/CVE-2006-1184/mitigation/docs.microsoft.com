Mitigating Factors for MSDTC Invalid Memory Access Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0034:

This is a denial of service vulnerability. This issue would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights, but it could cause the affected service to stop accepting requests.
If the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator stops responding because of an attack, services that are not dependant on the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator would continue to function normally. The affects of an attack will not typically affect the general stability of the system.
For customers who require the affected component, firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
