Workarounds for Microsoft Malware Protection Engine Vulnerability- CVE-2008-1437
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Microsoft Forefront Security for Exchange Server, Microsoft Forefront Security for SharePoint, and Microsoft Antigen support multiple engines in addition to the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine on a single system. If multiple engines are available on an affected system, administrators can disable the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine as a workaround, until the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine can be updated. Before disabling the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine, administrators should ensure they have installed the latest virus signatures for any third-party engine.
We have not identified any workarounds for Windows Live OneCare, Microsoft Windows Defender and Microsoft Forefront Client Security.
