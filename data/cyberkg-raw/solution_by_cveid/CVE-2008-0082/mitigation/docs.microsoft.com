Mitigating Factors for Messenger Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0082
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

By default, this ActiveX control, Messenger.UIAutomation.1, is not included in the default allow-list for ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer 7. Only customers who have explicitly approved this control by using the ActiveX opt-in feature are at risk to attempts to exploit this vulnerability. However, if a customer has used this ActiveX control in a previous version of Internet Explorer, then this ActiveX control is enabled to work in Internet Explorer 7, even if the customer has not explicitly approved it using the ActiveX opt-in feature.
Supported versions of Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems do not ship with the affected versions of Windows Messenger. Therefore, only customers who have installed the affected versions of Windows Messenger on these systems are at risk from this vulnerability.
Supported versions of Windows Vista ship with Windows Live Messenger but are not vulnerable. Therefore, upgrading to supported versions of Windows Vista and Windows Live Messenger is a mitigating factor.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the logged-on user on Windows Messenger. An attacker could also capture the user’s logon ID and remotely log on to the user’s Messenger client as that user. However, the attacker could not gain the logon ID or credentials of the user on the user’s computer system.
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s Web site.
By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability, by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail. However, if a user clicks on a link within an e-mail they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.
By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
