Workarounds for Windows Media Player PNG Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0025:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.
There are several different attack vectors that Microsoft has identified for this vulnerability. Each attack vector has a different workaround.
Note The following steps require Administrator privileges. We recommend that you restart the computer after you apply this workaround. Alternatively, you can log out and log back in after you apply the workaround.

Modify the Access Control List on the DirectX “Filter Graph no thread” Registry Key
Modifying the Access Control List on the “Filter Graph no thread” registry key helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To modify the Filter Graph no Thread Splitter registry key, follow these steps.
Note Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys and Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
Note We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.
