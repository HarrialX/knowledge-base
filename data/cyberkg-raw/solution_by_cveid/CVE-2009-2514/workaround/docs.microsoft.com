#### Workarounds for Win32k EOT Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2514
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Disable support for parsing embedded fonts in Internet Explorer**
  
    **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 969947](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/969947) to use the automated Microsoft Fix it solution to enable or disable this workaround.
  
    Disabling the support for the parsing of embedded fonts in Internet Explorer prevents this application from being used as an attack vector. However, additional attack vectors, such as embedded fonts within a Microsoft Office document, could still be exploited.
  
    **Using the Interactive Method**
  
    1.  In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.  
    2.  Click the **Security** tab.  
    3.  Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level.**  
    4.  Scroll down to the **Downloads** section and select **Prompt** or **Disable** for the **Font Downloading** security setting.  
    5.  Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.
  
    **Using Group Policy**
  
    **Note** The Group Policy MMC snap-in can be used to set policy for a machine, for an organizational unit or an entire domain. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:
  
-   [Group Policy collection](http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/6d7cb788-b31d-4d17-9f1e-b5ddaa6deecd1033.mspx?mfr=true)  
-   [What is Group Policy Object Editor?](http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/47ba1311-6cca-414f-98c9-2d7f99fca8a31033.mspx?mfr=true)  
-   [Core Group Policy tools and settings](http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/e926577a-5619-4912-b5d9-e73d4bdc94911033.mspx?mfr=true)
  
    Perform the following steps:
  
    1.  Open the Group Policy Management Console and configure it to work with the appropriate Group Policy object (e.g., local machine, OU or domain GPO).  
    2.  Navigate to the following node:  
        User Configuration - Windows Settings - Internet Explorer - Maintenance - Security  
    3.  Double-click **Security Zones and Content Rating.**  
    4.  In the Security Zones and Content Rating dialog box, select **Import the current security zones and privacy settings** and then click the **Modify Settings** button.  
        **Note** This will create a Group Policy for Internet Explorer based on the settings of the currently logged-on user.  
    5.  In the **Internet Properties** dialog box, ensure the **Internet** zone is selected and then press **Custom Level.**  
    6.  Scroll down to **Downloads** and set **Font Download** to **Prompt** or **Disable.**  
    7.  Click **OK** to return to the Internet Properties dialog box.  
    8.  Repeat these steps for the **Local Intranet** zone.  
    9.  Click **OK** three times to return to the Group Policy Management Console.  
    10. Refresh the Group Policy on all machines or wait for the next scheduled Group Policy refresh interval for the settings to take effect.
  
    **Using a Managed Deployment Script**
  
    This security setting can be manually entered into the registry by creating a registry script and importing it either by double-clicking it or running regedit.exe as part of a logon or machine startup script. For managed deployments Regedit.exe can be used to import a registry script silently with the '-s' switch. For more information on regedit command line switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 82821](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q82821/), "Registration Info Editor (REGEDIT) Command-Line Switches."
  
    To set this setting to 'Prompt' for the Internet and Local Intranet Zones paste the following text into a .REG file and then import the .REG file on managed machines as part of your organization's managed deployment process:
  
    ```
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
; Zone 1 is the local intranet zone
; 1604 is the Font download policy
; dword:00000001 sets the policy to prompt
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\1]
"1604"=dword:00000001
; Zone 3 is the internet zone
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\3]
"1604"=dword:00000001
```

To set this setting to 'Disable' for the Internet and Local Intranet Zones paste the following text into a .REG file and then import the .REG file on managed machines as part of your organization's managed deployment process:

```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

; Zone 1 is the local intranet zone
; 1604 is the Font download policy
; dword:00000003 sets the policy to disable
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\1]
"1604"=dword:00000003
; Zone 3 is the internet zone
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\3]
"1604"=dword:00000003
```

**Impact of workaround.** Web sites making use of embedded font technology will fail to display properly.


Deny Access to T2EMBED.DLL
On Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003:
For 32-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:
Echo y| cacls "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll" /E /P everyone:N
For 64-bit systems, enter the following command from an administrative command prompt:
Echo y| cacls "%windir%\syswow64\t2embed.dll" /E /P everyone:N
On Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008:
For 32-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:
Takeown.exe /f "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll"
Icacls.exe "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll" /save %TEMP%\t2embed_ACL.TXT
Icacls.exe "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll" /deny everyone:(F)

For 64-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:
Takeown.exe /f "%windir%\syswow64\t2embed.dll"
Icacls.exe "%windir%\syswow64\t2embed.dll" /save %TEMP%\t2embed_ACL.TXT
Icacls.exe "%windir%\syswow64\t2embed.dll" /deny everyone:(F)

Impact of workaround. Applications that rely on embedded font technology will fail to display properly.
How to undo the workaround.
