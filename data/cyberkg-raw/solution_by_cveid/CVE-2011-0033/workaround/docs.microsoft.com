Workarounds for OpenType Font Encoded Character Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0033
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Disable the Preview Pane and Details Pane in Windows Explorer
Disabling the Preview and Details panes in Windows Explorer prevents the automatic display of OTF fonts in Windows Explorer. While this prevents malicious files from being viewed in Windows Explorer, it does not prevent a local, authenticated user from running a specially crafted program to exploit this vulnerability. To disable these panes in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, perform the following steps:

Open Windows Explorer, click Organize, and then click Layout.
Clear both the Details pane and Preview pane menu options.
Click Organize, and then click Folder and search options.
Click the View tab.
Under Advanced settings, check the Always show icons, never thumbnails box.
Close all open instances of Windows Explorer for the change to take effect.

Impact of workaround. Windows Explorer will not automatically display OTF fonts.
How to undo the workaround.
To re-enable the Preview and Details panes in Windows Explorer for Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2:

Open Windows Explorer, click Organize, and then click Layout.
Select both the Details pane and Preview pane menu options.
Click Organize, and then click Folder and search options.
Click the View tab.
Under Advanced settings, clear the Always show icons, never thumbnails box.
Close all open instances of Windows Explorer for the change to take effect.


Disable the WebClient service
Disabling the WebClient service helps protect affected systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability by blocking the most likely remote attack vector through the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service. After applying this workaround it is still possible for remote attackers who successfully exploit this vulnerability to cause the system to run programs located on the targeted user's computer or the Local Area Network (LAN), but users will be prompted for confirmation before opening arbitrary programs from the Internet.
To disable the WebClient Service, perform the following steps:

Click Start, click Run, type Services.msc and then click OK.
Right-click WebClient service and select Properties.
Change the Startup type to Disabled. If the service is running, click Stop.
Click OK and exit the management application.

Impact of workaround. When the WebClient service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. In addition, any services that explicitly depend on the WebClient service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. For example, WebDAV shares will be inaccessible from the client computer.
How to undo the workaround.
To re-enable the WebClient Service, perform the following steps:

Click Start, click Run, type Services.msc and then click OK.
Right-click WebClient service and select Properties.
Change the Startup type to Automatic. If the service is not running, click Start.
Click OK and exit the management application.
