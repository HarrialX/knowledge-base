Update instructions
The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:
Ubuntu 18.04


snapcraft
              
              -
              
                2.43.1+18.04.1






Ubuntu 16.04


snapcraft
              
              -
              
                2.43.1+16.04.1






For users of the snap package, Snapcraft will automatically refresh
itself to Snapcraft 4.4.4 which is unaffected. For users of the deb
package, on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and 18.04 LTS, please perform a standard
system update. In either case, once Snapcraft has been updated, you need
to rebuild any packages built with the affected Snapcraft.
