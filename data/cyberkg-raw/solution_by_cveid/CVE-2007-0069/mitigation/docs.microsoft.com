#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Kernel TCP/IP/IGMPv3 and MLDv2 Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0069
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. Perimeter firewalls that block multicast traffic (IGMPv3 and MLDv2 specifically) help protect internal network assets from this attack that originate outside of the enterprise perimeter.  
-   Microsoft Windows 2000 is not affected by this vulnerability.  
-   Windows Server 2003 by default does not have any multicast addresses active and would not be affected by this vulnerability. However, installing applications that use multicasting could cause the operating system to become vulnerable.  
-   Attacks attempting to exploit this vulnerability would most likely result in a denial of service condition. However remote code execution could be possible.
  
#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Kernel TCP/IP/ICMP Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0066
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   Router Discovery Protocol (RDP) is not enabled by default and is required in order to exploit this vulnerability. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 269734](http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/db56b4d4-a351-40d5-b6b1-998e9f6f41c91033.mspx?mfr=true), “Router Discovery Protocol Is Disabled by Default.”  
-   Windows Vista is not affected by this vulnerability.
