Workarounds for WordPad and Office Text Converter Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0087
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources with affected versions of WordPad or Microsoft Office.
Do not open Office, RTF or Write files from untrusted sources using any software listed as affected in this bulletin on systems that are not updated with the security updates that accompany this bulletin. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.
This includes files that have .wri, .rtf, and .doc file associations. WordPad and Office could also be used to manually open documents. This includes all files that have .wri, .rtf, and .doc file extensions as well files with other extensions. Be aware that WordPad could also be used to open specially crafted documents regardless of the file name extension.

Disable the Word 6 converter by restricting access
An administrator can apply an access control list to affected converters to ensure that the converter is no longer loaded by WordPad and Office. This effectively prevents exploitation of the issue using this attack vector.
Warning Undo this workaround before installing this security update.
In order to apply the access list, run the following commands from the command prompt. Note that some of these may result in an error message, this is expected.
echo y| cacls "%ProgramFiles%\Windows NT\Accessories\mswrd6.wpc" /E /P everyone:Necho y| cacls "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\mswrd632.wpc" /E /P everyone:Necho y| cacls "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\mswrd632.cnv" /E /P everyone:Necho y| cacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\mswrd632.wpc" /E /P everyone:Necho y| cacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\mswrd632.cnv" /E /P everyone:Necho y| cacls "%ProgramFiles%\Windows NT\Accessories\mswrd664.wpc" /E /P everyone:Necho y| cacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Windows NT\Accessories\mswrd6.wpc" /E /P everyone:N
Impact of workaround. Upon implementing the workaround, the user will no longer be able to convert Word 6 documents to WordPad RTF or Word 2003 documents. Microsoft Office Word will return an error saying, "The file appears to be corrupted."
How to undo the workaround.
