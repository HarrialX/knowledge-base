Workarounds for MJPEG Decompression Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0084
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Disable the decoding of MJPEG content in Quartz.dll
To modify the registry key, follow these steps:
Note Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
Using the Interactive Method

Click Start, click Run, type Regedit in the Open box, and then click OK.
Locate and then click the following registry subkey: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{301056D0-6DFF-11D2-9EEB-006008039E37}
Click the File menu and select Export.
In the Export Registry File dialog box, enter MJPEG_Decoder_Backup.reg and click Save.
Note This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default.
Press the Delete key on the keyboard to delete the registry key. When prompted to delete the registry key via the Confirm Key Delete dialog box, click Yes.

Using a Managed Deployment Script

Create a backup copy of the registry keys by using a managed deployment script that contains the following commands:
Regedit.exe /e MJPEG_Decoder_Backup.reg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{301056D0-6DFF-11D2-9EEB-006008039E37}
Next, save the following to a file with a .REG extension, such as Disable_MJPEG_Decoder.reg:
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{301056D0-6DFF-11D2-9EEB-006008039E37}]
Run the above registry script on the target machine with the following command from an elevated command prompt:
Regedit.exe /s Disable_MJPEG_Decoder.reg

**Impact of workaround. **MJPEG content playback will be disabled.
How to undo the workaround.
Using the Interactive Method

Click Start, click Run, type Regedit in the Open box, and then click OK.
Click the File menu and select Import.
In the Import Registry File dialog box, select MJPEG_Decoder_Backup.reg and click Open.

Using a Managed Deployment Script
Restore the original state by running the following command:
Regedit.exe /s MJPEG_Decoder_Backup.reg

Unregister quartz.dll
To unregister this DLL, run the following command from an elevated command prompt.
For 32-bit Windows systems:
Regsvr32.exe –u %WINDIR%\system32\quartz.dll
For 64-bit Windows systems:
Regsvr32.exe –u %WINDIR%\syswow64\quartz.dll
**Impact of workaround. **Windows Media Player will not be able to play .AVI or .WAV files.
How to undo the workaround.
For 32-bit Windows systems:
Regsvr32.exe %WINDIR%\system32\quartz.dll
For 64-bit Windows systems:
Regsvr32.exe %WINDIR%\syswow64\quartz.dll
