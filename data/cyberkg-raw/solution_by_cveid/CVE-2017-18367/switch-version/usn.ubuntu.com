Update instructions
The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:
Ubuntu 16.04


golang-github-seccomp-libseccomp-golang-dev
              
              -
              
                0.0~git20150813.0.1b506fc-2+deb9u1build0.16.04.1






After a standard system update anything that depends on libseccomp-golang needs
to be rebuilt to make all the necessary changes.
