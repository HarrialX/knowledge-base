Workarounds for Microsoft Indexing Service Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0032:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Do not browse the Internet from a system in a server role
Do not browse the Internet from a Web server or a system in any other server role.

Disable page encoding auto-detection in Internet Explorer
Disabling the page encoding auto-detection in Internet Explorer helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.
To configure components and services:

Launch Internet Explorer.
Click on View, click Encoding, if Auto-select has a check mark next to it, and left click Auto-select to de-select this setting.

Impact of Workaround: Internet Explorer may fail to properly detect the encoding used on web pages that do not specify a default character encoding, resulting in encoded characters being displayed incorrectly. The user can still manually select the proper encoding type to display the page properly.

Use URLScan on Windows 2000 running IIS 5.0
The installation of URLScan helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

Install URLScan, in its default configuration URLScan 2.5 will block requests for .IDA, .IDQ and .HTW files which are the affected Index Server extensions.
Restart the IISAdmin and WWW Publishing services for the changes to take effect.

Impact of Workaround: The default configuration of URLScan will block requests for Index Server file types (.IDA, .IDQ, .HTW) and as such will block any web based searches that make use of these file types.

Remove the Index Server ISAPI extension Script Mappings from Internet Information Service for Windows 2000 running IIS 5.0
The removal of the Index Server ISAPI extension Script Mappings from IIS helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

Double-click Administrative Tools.
Double-click Internet Information Services.
Right click WebServer, select Properties.
. Select within Master Properties, select WWW Service and click Edit.
On the WWW ServiceMaster Properties, select Home Directory and click Configuration.
On the Application Configuration, highlight the .HTW, .IDA and .IDQ extensions and click Remove.

Impact of Workaround: The default configuration of URLScan will block requests for Index Server file types (.IDA, .IDQ, .HTW) and as such will block any web based searches that make use of these file types.
