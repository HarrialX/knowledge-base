Mitigating Factors for IGMP v3 DoS Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0021:

Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
Note Windows Firewall will help protect against attacks utilizing a unicast IGMP v3 packet, however, it will not help protect against an attack utilizing a multicast IGMP v3 packet.
