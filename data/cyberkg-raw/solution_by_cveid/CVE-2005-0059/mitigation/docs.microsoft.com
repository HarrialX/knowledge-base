Mitigating Factors for Message Queuing Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0059:

By default, the Message Queuing component is not installed on any affected operating system version. Only customers who manually install the Message Queuing component are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.
Message Queuing installations that expose only MSMQ HTTP Message Delivery to the Internet are not vulnerable.
For customers that require the affected component, firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
