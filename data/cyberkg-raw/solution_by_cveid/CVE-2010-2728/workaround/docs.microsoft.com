#### Workarounds for Heap Based Buffer Overflow in Outlook Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2728
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Read e-mails in plain text**
  
    To help protect yourself from the e-mail attack vector, read e-mail messages in plain text format.
  
    Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Microsoft Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view in plain text only those e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted.
  
    Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).
  
    **Impact of workaround.**Â E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:
  
    -   The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.  
    -   Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.  
    -   Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.
