Mitigating Factors for Microsoft .NET Framework Pointer Verification Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0090
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

Microsoft .NET applications that are not malicious are not at risk for being compromised because of this vulnerability. Only applications built in a specifically malicious way could exploit this vulnerability.
In a Web-hosting scenario, an attacker must have permission to upload arbitrary ASP.NET pages to a Web site and ASP.NET must be installed on that Web server. In default configuration, an anonymous user cannot upload and run Microsoft .NET code on an Internet Information Server (IIS).
By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode mitigates this vulnerability only in a Web-based attack scenario. See the FAQ section of this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
Internet Explorer 8 disables the Microsoft .NET MIME Filter in the Internet zone. This feature of Internet Explorer 8 makes successful exploitation of this vulnerability more difficult by blocking a known technique for bypassing ASLR and DEP protection. Disabling the Microsoft .NET MIME Filter in the Internet zone does not make it impossible to exploit this vulnerability in Internet Explorer 8, but it does make it more difficult for malicious Web sites to reliably exploit it.
In a Web-browsing attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user or the user account of ASP.NET. Users or accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users or accounts that operate with administrative user rights.

Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Silverlight and Microsoft .NET Framework CLR Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2497
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

The current version of Microsoft Silverlight, Silverlight 3, is not affected by this vulnerability. By default, Silverlight will periodically check a Microsoft Web site for updates to provide you with the latest features and improvements. If a newer version is available, it will be downloaded and installed on your computer. Most systems will already be running a version of Silverlight 3. For more information, see Microsoft Silverlight Updater.
