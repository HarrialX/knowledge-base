#### Mitigating Factors for Canonical Display Driver Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3678
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   This vulnerability only impacts Windows systems that have the Windows Aero theme installed. By default, Windows Aero is not enabled in Windows Server 2008 R2. Also, Windows Server 2008 R2 does not include Windows Aero-capable graphics drivers. To enable Windows Aero, you must obtain graphics drivers from a third-party vendor or from the graphics adapter manufacturer.  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâ€™s Web site.
