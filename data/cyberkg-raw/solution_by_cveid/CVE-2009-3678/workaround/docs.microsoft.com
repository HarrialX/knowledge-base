#### Workarounds for Canonical Display Driver Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3678
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Disable the Windows Aero Theme**
  
Disabling the Windows Aero theme prevents this issue from being exploited on affected systems.
  
**Using the Interactive Method**
  
To disable Windows Aero by changing the theme, perform the following steps for each user on a system:
  
1.  Click **Start**, select the Control Panel, and then click on **Appearance and Personalization**.  
2.  Under the **Personalization** category, click on **Change the Theme**.  
3.  Scroll to the bottom of the listed themes and select one of the available **Basic and High Contrast Themes.**
  
**Using Group Policy**
  
**Note** The Group Policy MMC snap-in can be used to set policy for a machine, for an organizational unit or an entire domain. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:

To disable Windows Aero by switching to the default setting through group policy, perform the following steps:
  
1.  Open the Group Policy Management Console and configure the console to work with the appropriate Group Policy object, such as, local machine, OU, or domain GPO.  
2.  Navigate to the following node:  
    User Configuration - Policies - Administrative Templates - Control Panel - Personalization  
3.  Double-click **Force a specific visual style file or force Windows Classic**.  
4.  Change the setting to **Enabled** and ensure that the **Path to Visual Style** text box is blank.  
5.  Click **Apply** and click **OK** to return to the Group Policy Management Console.  
6.  Refresh the Group Policy on all systems or wait for the next scheduled Group Policy refresh interval for the settings to take effect.
