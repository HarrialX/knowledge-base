Workarounds for Media Decompression Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1879
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Disable decoding of MJPEG content in Quartz.dll on Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003

Create a backup copy of the registry keys by using a managed deployment script that contains the following commands:
regedit /e MJPEG_Decoder_Backup.reg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{301056D0-6DFF-11D2-9EEB-006008039E37}


Next, save the following to a file with a .REG extension, such as Disable_MJPEG_Decoder.reg:
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{301056D0-6DFF-11D2-9EEB-006008039E37}]


Run the above registry script on the target machine with the following command from an elevated command prompt:
Regedit.exe /s Disable_MJPEG_Decoder.reg



Impact of workaround: Disabling the decoding of MJPEG content will prevent playback.
How to undo the workaround. Run the above registry script on the target machine with the following command from an elevated command prompt:
Regedit.exe /s Disable_MJPEG_Decoder.reg


Modify the Access Control List for Windows Media Format Runtime (wmvcore.dll)
On Windows XP (all editions), run the following command from a command prompt (requires administrative privileges):
For 32-bit Windows:
cacls <PATH_AND_FILENAME> /E /P everyone:N

For 64-bit Windows:
cacls <64BIT_PATH_AND_FILENAME> /E /P everyone:N

Note Be sure to consider paths in 64-bit Windows such as %ProgramFiles(86)% and %windir%\SysWOW64.
How to undo the workaround. Run the following commands from a command prompt (requires administrative privileges).
On Windows XP (all editions):
For 32-bit Windows:
cacls <PATH_AND_FILENAME> /E /R everyone

For 64-bit Windows:
cacls <64BIT_PATH_AND_FILENAME> /E /R everyone

Note Be sure to consider paths in 64-bit Windows such as %ProgramFiles(86)% and %windir%\SysWOW64.
