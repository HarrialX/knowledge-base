Mitigating Factors for MMC Redirect Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3643:

Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 will not open local files from the Internet Zone. Note that Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 will still open local files, and thus is vulnerable, from sites in the Local Intranet or Trusted Sites zones.

An attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018 has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability.
The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:

Apply the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-040 or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.
Use Internet Explorer 6 or a later version.
Use the latest security update for Microsoft Outlook, use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or a later version, or use Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or a later version in its default configuration.
