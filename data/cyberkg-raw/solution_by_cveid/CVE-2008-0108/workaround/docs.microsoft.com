Workarounds for Microsoft Works File Converter Input Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0216
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Disable installed copies of the Works File Converter by restricting access to WKCVQD01.DLL
To manually restrict access to the WKCVQD01.DLL, run the following commands from the command line:
Note You will need administrator privileges to set these file restrictions.
For Windows XP:
echo y| cacls "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft shared\TextConv\wkcvqd01.dll" /E /P everyone:N
For Windows Vista:
takeown.exe /f "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\wkcvqd01.dll"
icacls.exe "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\wkcvqd01.dll" /save %TEMP%\wkcvqd01 _ACL.TXT
icacls.exe "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\wkcvqd01.dll" /deny everyone:(F)
Impact of workaround: After applying these changed, users will no longer be able to open Microsoft Works files in Microsoft Office.
Rollback: Run the following commands from a command prompt:
For Windows XP:
cacls "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\wkcvqd01.dll" /E /R everyone
For Windows Vista:
icacls "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\wkcvqd01.dll" /grant everyone:(F)
icacls "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv" /restore %TEMP%\wkcvqd01_ACL.TXT

Prevent WKCVQD01.DLL from being installed
To manually restrict WKCVQD01.DLL from being installed, run the following commands from the command line:
Note You will need administrator privileges to set these file restrictions.
For Windows XP:
md "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\"
echo Placeholder > "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\wkcvqd01.dll"
echo y| cacls "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\wkcvqd01.dll" /E /P everyone:N
For Windows Vista:
md "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\"
echo Placeholder > "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\wkcvqd01.dll"
icacls.exe "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\wkcvqd01.dll" /deny everyone:(F)
Impact of Workaround: After applying these changes, users will no longer be able to install Microsoft Works File Converters nor open Microsoft Works files in Microsoft Office.
Rollback: Run the following commands from a command prompt:
For Windows XP:
cacls "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\wkcvqd01.dll" /E /R everyone
echo y| del "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\wkcvqd01.dll"
For Windows Vista:
icacls "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\wkcvqd01.dll" /grant everyone:(F)
echo y| del "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\wkcvqd01.dll"

Do not open or save Microsoft Works files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.
