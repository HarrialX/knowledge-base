Mitigating Factors for Uniform Resource Locator Validation Error Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3007
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

In a Web-based attack scenario, a Web site could contain a specially crafted link (onenote://) that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site and open a specially crafted OneNote URL, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site, and then convincing them to click the specially crafted link.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through previewing an e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must click a specially crafted link that is sent in an e-mail message.
