#### Mitigating Factors for Shortcut Icon Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2568
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.  
-   For the USB removable device attack vector, when AutoPlay is disabled, the user would manually have to launch Windows Explorer or a similar application and browse to the affected folder of the removable disk.
