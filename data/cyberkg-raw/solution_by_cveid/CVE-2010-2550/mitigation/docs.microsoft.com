#### Mitigating Factors for SMB Pool Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2550
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. In this case, the SMB ports should be blocked from the Internet.  
-   In Windows Vista and Windows 7, if the network profile is set to "Public", the system is not affected by this vulnerability since unsolicited inbound network packets are blocked by default.
  
#### Mitigating Factors for SMB Variable Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2551
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   This vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or elevate their user rights, but it could cause the affected system to stop responding until manually restarted.  
-   Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. In this case, the SMB ports should be blocked from the Internet.  
-   In Windows Vista and Windows 7, if the network profile is set to "Public", the system is not affected by this vulnerability since unsolicited inbound network packets are blocked by default.
  
#### Mitigating Factors for SMB Stack Exhaustion Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2552
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. In this case, the SMB ports should be blocked from the Internet.  
-   In Windows Vista and Windows 7, if the network profile is set to "Public", the system is not affected by this vulnerability since unsolicited inbound network packets are blocked by default.
