#### Mitigating Factors for Integer Overflow in IPP Service Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1446
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is enabled by default on IIS for Microsoft Windows 2000 and Windows XP. However, the default file permissions across all platforms are set so that IPP can only be accessed by users in the "Authenticated" group. Because of this restriction, unauthenticated users by default will not have the necessary folder permissions to exploit this vulnerability remotely.  
-   Installations of IIS on Windows Server 2003 are not vulnerable in their default configuration. Only Windows Server 2003 installations that have enabled the Internet Printing Protocol ISAPI filter within IIS are vulnerable. Both the Internet Printing and Active Server Pages components are necessary to enable Web-based printer management and Internet printing. If Active Server Pages component is set to "Allowed" and Internet Printing component is set to "Prohibited," only Web-based printer management is enabled. Users cannot connect to any shared printers through Internet Printing.  
-   Installations of IIS on Windows Server 2008 are not vulnerable by default. A computer running Windows Server 2008 can act as a client computer that uses Internet printing. Users of the computer who make print requests must be authenticated by the print server, however, before they can use any of the printers connected to that server. To enable a computer running Windows Server 2008 to act as a server supporting Internet printing, you must install the Web Server (IIS) role, the Print Services role, and the Internet Printing role service in the Print Services role.  
-   Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that the IIS server communicate outbound to a malicious computer on port 445. Administrators who block outbound SMB connections from their IIS server to the Internet can prevent exploitation of this vulnerability from untrusted systems.
