Mitigating Factors for DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control Cross Domain Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1319:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could also attempt to compromise a Web site to have it display a Web page with malicious content. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or to a site that has been compromised by the attacker.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

By default, Microsoft Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2000, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018 has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability.
The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:

Install the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-040 or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.
Use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or a later version in its default configuration, or use Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or a later version in its default configuration.


By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

Windows XP Service Pack 2 introduced a security enhancement known as the Local Machine zone lockdown. This security enhancement mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this security update for more information about Local Machine zone lockdown.
