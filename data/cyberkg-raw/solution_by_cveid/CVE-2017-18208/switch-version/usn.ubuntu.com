Update instructions
The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:
Ubuntu 17.10


linux-image-4.13.0-1020-raspi2
              
              -
              
                4.13.0-1020.21






linux-image-raspi2
              
              -
              
                4.13.0.1020.18






After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.
ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.
Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages
(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,
linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform
this as well.
