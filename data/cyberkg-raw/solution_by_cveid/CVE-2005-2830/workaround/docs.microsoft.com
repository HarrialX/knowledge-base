Workarounds for File Download Dialog Box Manipulation Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2829:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone

You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the Tools menu.
Click the Security tab.
Click Internet, and then click Custom Level.
Under Settings, in the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.
Click Local intranet, and then click Custom Level.
Under Settings, in the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.
If you are prompted to confirm that you want to change these settings, click Yes.
Click OK to return to Internet Explorer.

Note Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.
Impact of Workaround: There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click Yes to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the "Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites" workaround.

Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones

You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.
To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click Internet Options.
In the Internet Options dialog box, click the Security tab, and then click the Internet icon.
Under Security level for this zone, move the slider to High. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.
Note If no slider is visible, click Default Level, and then move the slider to High.
Note Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.
Click Custom Level.
Under Settings, in the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click Prompt and then click OK.
If you are prompted to confirm that you want to change these settings, click Yes.
Click OK to return to Internet Explorer.

Impact of Workaround: There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click Yes to run ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the "Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites" workaround.

Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites

After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.
To do this, follow these steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Tools, click Internet Options, and then click the Security tab.
In the Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings box, click Trusted Sites, click Default Level, move the slider to Medium, and then click Sites.
Note Setting the level to Medium is a suggested added precaution. It may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly if you have placed sites in the Trusted sites zone that require the default setting of Low.
If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone check box.
In the Add this Web site to the zone box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click Add.
Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
Click OK two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. One in particular that you may want to add is "*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" (without the quotation marks). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
Workarounds for HTTPS Proxy Vulnerability- CAN-2005-2830:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Prevent COM objects from running in Internet Explorer

You can disable attempts to instantiate a COM object in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
For detailed steps about preventing a control from running in Internet Explorer, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797. Follow these steps and create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.
For example, to set the kill bit for a CLSID in the Avifil32.dll, file that is included in this security update, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{0002000D-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}]
"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400
You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:
Group Policy collection
What is Group Policy Object Editor?
Core Group Policy tools and settings
Note You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.
Impact of Workaround: There is no impact as long as the COM object is not intended to be used in Internet Explorer.
