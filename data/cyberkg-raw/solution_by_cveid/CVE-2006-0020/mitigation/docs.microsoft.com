Mitigating Factors for WMF Image Parsing Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0020:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. Also, Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites, may contain malicious content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attackerâ€™s Web site.
In an e-mail based attack of this exploit, customers would have to open a malicious e-mail message, preview a malicious e-mail message in the Outlook Express preview pane, click on a link that would take them to a malicious Web site, or open an attachment that could exploit the vulnerability. Users can disable the preview pane in Outlook Express and delete the suspicious e-mail message without opening the e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
In an e-mail based attack of this exploit, customers would have to open a malicious e-mail message, preview a malicious e-mail message in the Outlook preview pane, click on a link that would take them to a malicious Web site, or open an attachment that could exploit the vulnerability. Users can disable the preview pane in Outlook and delete the suspicious e-mail message without opening the e-mail message. Customers who read e-mail in plain text in Outlook would have to click on a link that would take them to a malicious Web site, or open an attachment to be at risk from this vulnerability.
