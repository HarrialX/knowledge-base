#### Workarounds for Visio DXF File Format Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1888
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Do not open Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources**
  
    Do not open Visio files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.
