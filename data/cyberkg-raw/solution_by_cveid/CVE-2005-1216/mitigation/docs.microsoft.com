Mitigating Factors for HTTP Content Header Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1215:

An attacker would only be able to poison the cache with existing content from the IP address or domain name of the targeted server
Due to the way that caching works, an attacker would need to be able to submit a malicious request before a valid version of the page is cached via another method, either user or automatically invoked.
ISA Servers that are configured in Firewall Mode are not vulnerable to this issue.
Typical usage of Internet Explorer will not produce malformed HTTP requests.
