#### Mitigating Factors for Fax Cover Page Editor Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3974
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   On all supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, the Windows Fax Cover Page Editor is not installed by default. For the Windows Fax Cover Page Editor to be available, the Fax Services component of these operating systems would need to be enabled.  
-   On all supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, by default, the affected file type (.cov) is not registered to any program. For an attack to be successful, a user would first need to open the Windows Fax Cover Page Editor and then open a specially crafted .cov file.  
-   The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
