Mitigating Factors for IP Validation Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0048:

This attack requires that routers forward malformed IP network packets. Most routers will not forward these kinds of malformed IP network packets.
Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. Affected systems that allow any IP connections to the Internet may be vulnerable to this issue.
If enabled, the Internet Connection Firewall does mitigate this vulnerability on Windows XP Service Pack 1. Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 were not vulnerable to this issue.

Mitigating Factors for ICMP Connection Reset Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0790:

Firewall best practices and firewall or router configurations that block all ICMP traffic can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
For an attacker to try to exploit this vulnerability, they must first predict or learn the IP address and port information of the source and of the destination of an existing TCP network connection.
This attack would have to be performed on each TCP connection that was targeted for reset. Many applications will automatically restore connections that have been reset.

Mitigating Factors for ICMP Path MTU Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1060:

Firewall best practices and firewall or router configurations that block all ICMP traffic can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
For an attacker to try to exploit this vulnerability, they must first predict or learn the IP address information of the source and of the destination of an existing TCP network connection.

Mitigating Factors for TCP Connection Reset Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0230:

For an attacker to try to exploit this vulnerability, they must first predict or learn the IP address and port information of the source and of the destination of an existing TCP network connection. An attacker would also have to predict or to learn certain difficult TCP network packet details. Protocols or programs that maintain long sessions and have predictable TCP/IP information are at an increased risk for this issue.
Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. Affected systems that allow any TCP connections to the Internet may be vulnerable to this issue.
This attack would have to be performed on each TCP connection that was targeted for reset. Many applications will automatically restore connections that have been reset.

Mitigating Factors for Spoofed Connection Request Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0688:

The affected system would function as normal after the malicious packets are finished processing.
This attack requires that routers forward malformed TCP/IP network packets. Most routers will not forward these kinds of malformed TCP/IP network packets.
Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. Affected systems that allow any IP connections to the Internet may be vulnerable to this issue.
Windows Server 2003 systems that have enabled the SynAttackProtect registry value are not vulnerable to this issue. For information on how to enable this registry value, see the “Workarounds” section of this vulnerability. This registry value does not protect other affected operating systems.
