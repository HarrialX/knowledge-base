Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.
Workarounds for TrueType Font Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0159
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Deny access to T2EMBED.DLL
Note Before applying this workaround, users should apply the latest Microsoft security updates. If you are not sure whether your software is up to date, visit Microsoft Update, scan your computer for available updates, and install any high-priority updates that are offered to you.
Note For this workaround, commands for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 may only work in English language versions of these operating systems.
Note This workaround only mitigates the web-based and file sharing attack scenarios related to the Windows Kernel-Mode Drivers. The local Kernel-Mode Drivers attack scenario, and all other attack scenarios that leverage code in other affected Windows components, Microsoft Office and Microsoft Silverlight will not be mitigated by this workaround.
Note See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2639417 to use the automated Microsoft Fix it solution to enable or disable this workaround to deny access to t2embed.dll.
On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003:

For 32-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:
Echo y| cacls "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll" /E /P everyone:N

For 64-bit systems, enter the following commands from an administrative command prompt:
Echo y| cacls "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll" /E /P everyone:N
Echo y| cacls "%windir%\syswow64\t2embed.dll" /E /P everyone:N


On Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2:

For 32-bit systems, enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:
Takeown.exe /f "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll"
Icacls.exe "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll" /deny *S-1-1-0:(F)

For 64-bit systems, enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:
Takeown.exe /f "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll"
Icacls.exe "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll" /deny *S-1-1-0:(F)
Takeown.exe /f "%windir%\syswow64\t2embed.dll"
Icacls.exe "%windir%\syswow64\t2embed.dll" /deny *S-1-1-0:(F)


Impact of Workaround.Â 

Applications that rely on embedded font technology will fail to display properly.
After applying this workaround, users of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 may be reoffered the KB982132 and KB972270 security updates. These reoffered updates will fail to install. The reoffering is a detection logic issue and users who have successfully applied both the KB982132 and KB972270 security updates previously can ignore the reoffer.
Applications with functionality that relies on T2EMBED.DLL, such as generating PDF files, may fail to work as expected. For example, Microsoft Office software will fail to generate PDF files.
Microsoft Office 2003 software with the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack may fail to open PowerPoint 2007 (.pptx) files; instead, generating the message, "This file was created by a newer version of Microsoft PowerPoint. Do you want to download a compatibility pack so that you can work with this file?", even though the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack is already installed.

How to undo the workaround.
On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003:

For 32-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:
cacls "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll" /E /R everyone

For 64-bit systems, enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:
cacls "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll" /E /R everyone
cacls "%windir%\syswow64\t2embed.dll" /E /R everyone


On Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2:

For 32-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:
Icacls.exe "%windir%\system32\t2embed.DLL" /remove:d *S-1-1-0

For 64-bit systems, enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:
Icacls.exe "%windir%\system32\t2embed.DLL" /remove:d *S-1-1-0
Icacls.exe "%windir%\syswow64\t2embed.DLL" /remove:d *S-1-1-0




Workarounds for .NET Framework Buffer Allocation Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0162
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Disable XAML browser applications in Internet Explorer
To help protect against this vulnerability, change your settings to prompt before running XAML browser applications (XBAPs) or to disable XBAPs in the Internet and Local intranet security zones as follows:

In Internet Explorer, click the Tools menu and then select Internet Options.
Click the Security tab, click Internet, and then click Custom level. Under Settings, for Loose XAML, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.
Click the Security tab, click Internet, and then click Custom level. Under Settings, for XAML browser applications, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.
Click the Security tab, click Internet, and then click Custom level. Under Settings, for XPS documents, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.
On the Security tab, click Custom level. Under .NET Framework-reliant components, set Run components not signed with Authenticode to either Prompt or Disable, and then click OK. Repeat this step for Run components signed with Authenticode, and then click OK.
Click Local intranet, and then click Custom Level. Repeat steps 3 and 4. If you are prompted to confirm that you want to change these settings, click Yes. Click OK to return to Internet Explorer.

Impact of workaround. Microsoft .NET code will not run in Internet Explorer or will not run without prompting. Disabling Microsoft .NET applications and components in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.
Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone
After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.
To do this, perform the following steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Tools, click Internet Options, and then click the Security tab.
In the Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings box, click Trusted Sites, and then click Sites.
If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone check box.
In the Add this Web site to the zone box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click Add.
Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
Click OK two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

Note Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are *.windowsupdate.microsoft.com and *.update.microsoft.com. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
How to undo the workaround. Perform the following steps:

In Internet Explorer, click the Tools menu, and then select Internet Options.
Click the Security tab, click Reset all zones to default level, and then click OK.

Workarounds for Silverlight Double-Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0176
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Temporarily prevent the Microsoft Silverlight ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer (Method 1)
You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by temporarily preventing attempts to instantiate the Silverlight ActiveX control in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control.
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
We recommend that you back up the registry before you edit it.
Use the following text to create a .reg file that temporarily prevents attempts to instantiate the Silverlight ActiveX control in Internet Explorer. You can copy the following text, paste it into a text editor such as Notepad, and then save the file with the .reg file name extension. Run the .reg file on the vulnerable client.
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{DFEAF541-F3E1-4C24-ACAC-99C30715084A}]
"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

Close Internet Explorer and reopen it for the changes to take effect.
For detailed steps about stopping a control from running in Internet Explorer, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797. Follow these steps and create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent the Silverlight ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer.
Impact of workaround. Applications and websites that require the Microsoft Silverlight ActiveX control may no longer function correctly. If you implement this workaround it would affect any Silverlight ActiveX control you have installed on your system.
How to undo the workaround. Remove the registry keys added to temporarily prevent attempts to instantiate the Silverlight ActiveX control in Internet Explorer.

Temporarily prevent the Microsoft Silverlight ActiveX control from running in Firefox or Chrome
To modify the registry key to disable Microsoft Silverlight, follow these steps:
