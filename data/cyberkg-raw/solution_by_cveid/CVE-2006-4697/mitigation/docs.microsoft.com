Mitigating Factors for COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4697:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability In addition, Web sites that accept or host user-provided content, or compromised Web sites and advertisement servers could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce the number of successful attacks that exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail. However, if a user clicks on a link within an e-mail, they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.
By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that have not been added to Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
COM Objects not intended to be instantiated in Internet Explorer are not included in the default allow-list for ActiveX controls in Windows Internet Explorer 7. Customers who are running Windows Internet Explorer 7 with default settings are therefore not at risk unless these COM Objects have been activated through the ActiveX opt-in feature in the Internet Zone. Customers who are upgrading to Windows Internet Explorer 7 and have enabled these COM objects in previous versions of Internet Explorer will have them enabled in Windows Internet Explorer 7. For more information on the ActiveX Opt-in feature and how to add ActiveX controls to the pre-approved list, see the product documentation.
Windows Internet Explorer 7 in Windows Vista is not affected by this vulnerability.

Mitigating Factors for FTP Server Response Parsing Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0217:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host an FTP server that would return these specially crafted FTP server responses to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the site with the FTP server. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail. However, if a user clicks on a link within an e-mail they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.
Note It cannot be ruled out that this vulnerability could be used in an exploit without Active Scripting. However, using Active Scripting significantly increases the chances of a successful exploit. As a result, this vulnerability has been given a severity rating of Critical on Windows Server 2003.
By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that have not been added to Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
