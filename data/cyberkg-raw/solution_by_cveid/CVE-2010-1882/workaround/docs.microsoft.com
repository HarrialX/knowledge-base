#### Workarounds for MPEG Layer-3 Audio Decoder Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1882
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Unregister l3codecx.ax**
  
    On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 systems, run the following commands from a command prompt.
  
    For 32-bit Windows:  
`Regsvr32.exe –u %WINDIR%\system32\l3codecx.ax`

For 64-bit Windows:  

`Regsvr32.exe –u %WINDIR%\syswow64\l3codecx.ax`

**Impact of workaround.** MPEG Layer-3 Parsing is disabled in applications that use DirectShow to play MPEG Layer-3 content.

**How to undo the workaround.**

On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 systems, run the following commands from a command prompt.

For 32-bit Windows:  
`Regsvr32.exe %WINDIR%\system32\l3codecx.ax`

For 64-bit Windows:  

`Regsvr32.exe %WINDIR%\syswow64\l3codecx.ax`


Deny access to l3codecx.ax
On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 systems run the following commands from a command prompt.
For 32-bit Windows:
cacls %WINDIR%\system32\l3codecx.ax /E /P everyone:N
For 64-bit Windows:
cacls %WINDIR%\syswow64\l3codecx.ax /E /P everyone:N
Impact of workaround. MPEG Layer-3 Parsing is disabled in applications that use DirectShow to play MPEG Layer-3 content.
How to undo the workaround.
On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 systems run the following commands from a command prompt.
For 32-bit Windows:
cacls %WINDIR%\system32\l3codecx.ax /E /R everyone
For 64-bit Windows:
cacls %WINDIR%\syswow64\l3codecx.ax /E /R everyone

Disable MPEG Layer-3 parsing in DirectShow
Removing the registry key specified below prevents MPEG Layer-3 parsing in applications that use DirectShow to play MPEG Layer-3 content.
Note Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
Using the Interactive Method
For 32-bit Windows systems:

Click Start, click Run, type Regedit in the Open box, and then click OK.
Locate the following subkey:
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{38BE3000-DBF4-11D0-860E-00A024CFEF6D}
On the File menu, click Export.
In the Export Registry File dialog box, enter MP3_Parser_Backup.reg and click Save.
Note This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default.
Press the Delete key on the keyboard to delete the registry key. When prompted to delete the registry key via the Confirm Key Delete dialog box, click Yes.

For 64-bit Windows systems:

Click Start, click Run, type Regedit in the Open box, and then click OK.
Locate the following subkey:
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Wow6432Node\CLSID\{38BE3000-DBF4-11D0-860E-00A024CFEF6D}
On the File menu, click Export.
In the Export Registry File dialog box, enter MP3_Parser_Backup1.reg and click Save.
Note This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default.
Press the Delete key on the keyboard to delete the registry key. When prompted to delete the registry key via the Confirm Key Delete dialog box, click Yes.
Click Start, click Run, type Regedit in the Open box, and then click OK.
Locate the following subkey:
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Wow6432Node\CLSID\{38BE3000-DBF4-11D0-860E-00A024CFEF6D}
On the File menu, click Export.
In the Export Registry File dialog box, enter MP3_Parser_Backup 2.reg and click Save.
Note This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default.
Press the Delete key on the keyboard to delete the registry key. When prompted to delete the registry key via the Confirm Key Delete dialog box, click Yes.

Using a Managed Deployment Script

Create a backup copy of the registry keys by using a managed deployment script that contains the following commands:
For 32-bit Windows systems:
Regedit.exe /e MP3_Parser_Backup.reg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{38BE3000-DBF4-11D0-860E-00A024CFEF6D}
For 64-bit Windows Systems:
Regedit.exe /e MP3_Parser_Backup.reg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Wow6432Node\CLSID\{38BE3000-DBF4-11D0-860E-00A024CFEF6D}

Next, save the following to a file with a .REG extension, such as Disable_MP3_Parser.reg:
For 32-bit Windows systems:
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{38BE3000-DBF4-11D0-860E-00A024CFEF6D}]
For 64-bit Windows Systems:
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Wow6432Node\CLSID\{38BE3000-DBF4-11D0-860E-00A024CFEF6D}]

Run the above registry script on the target machine with the following command from an elevated command prompt:
Regedit.exe /s Disable_MP3_Parser.reg


Impact of workaround. MPEG Layer-3 Parsing is disabled in applications that use DirectShow to play MPEG Layer-3 content.
