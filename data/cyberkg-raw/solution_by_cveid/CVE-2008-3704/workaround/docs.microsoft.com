Workarounds for DataGrid Control Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4252
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Prevent DataGrid ActiveX Control from running in Internet Explorer
You can disable attempts to instantiate a COM object in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
For detailed steps that you can use to prevent an ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797.
Follow these steps in this article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.

Replace {cde57a43-8b86-11d0-b3c6-00a0c90aea82} below with the Class Identifiers found in this section.

To set the kill bit for a CLSID with a value of {cde57a43-8b86-11d0-b3c6-00a0c90aea82}, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.
