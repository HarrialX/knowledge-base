Mitigating Factors for Windows Media Encoder Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3008
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

By default, Windows Media Encoder 9 Series is not installed on any version of Windows. The 32-bit edition of Windows Media Encoder 9 Series, which can be installed on either x86 or x64 systems, must be downloaded from Windows Media Encoder 9 Series at the Microsoft Download Center. The 64-bit edition of Windows Media Encoder 9 Series, which can be installed only on x64-based systems, must be downloaded from Windows Media Encoder 9 Series x64 Edition at the Microsoft Download Center. Systems without Windows Media Encoder 9 Series or Windows Media Encoder 9 Series x64 Edition are not vulnerable.
By default, this ActiveX control is not activated on systems running Internet Explorer 7, unless the control has been explicitly activated through the ActiveX opt-in feature in the Internet Zone. However, if a customer has used this ActiveX control in a previous version of Internet Explorer, then this ActiveX control is enabled to work in Internet Explorer 7, even if the customer has not explicitly approved it using the ActiveX opt-in feature.
By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also the Microsoft Download Center white paper, Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
