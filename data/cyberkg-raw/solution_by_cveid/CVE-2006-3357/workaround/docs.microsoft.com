Workarounds for Buffer Overrun in HTML Help Vulnerability- CVE-2006-3357:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Disable the HTML Help ActiveX control from running within Internet Explorer 6 for Windows XP Service Pack 2.
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings within Internet Explorer to disable the ActiveX control hhtctrl.ocx from running.
To disable the HTML Help ActiveX control in Microsoft Internet Explorer:

On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click Manage Add-ons.
Locate and click on “HHCTRL Object”.
To disable the add-on, click Disable and then click OK.

Impact of Workaround: Disabling the HTML Help ActiveX control prevents Internet Explorer from instantiating the control. This configuration causes program compatibility issues. Some examples of such issues are:

In Help and Support Center, the Index feature no longer works.
In HTML Help, features such as Related Topics and Shortcuts no longer work.

Features that are provided by the HTML Help control in Enterprise intranet programs no longer work.

Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running ActiveX controls and active scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone.
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and active scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.
To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer:

On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click Internet Options.
In the Internet Options dialog box, click the Security tab, and then click the Internet icon.
Under Security level for this zone, move the slider to High. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

Note If no slider is visible, click Default Level, and then move the slider to High.
Note Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the high security setting.
Alternatively, you can change you settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls only by following these steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the Tools menu.
Click the Security tab.
Click Internet, and then click Custom Level.
Under Settings, in the ActiveX controls and plug-ins section, under Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins, click Prompt.
In the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click Prompt, and then click OK.
Click Local intranet, and then click Custom Level.
Under Settings, in the ActiveX controls and plug-ins section, under Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins, click Prompt.
In the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click Prompt.
Click OK two times to return to Internet Explorer.

Impact of Workaround: There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click Yes to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the "Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites" workaround.

Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites.
After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and active scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.
To do this, follow these steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Tools, click Internet Options, and then click the Security tab.
In the Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings box, click Trusted Sites, and then click Sites.
If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone check box.
In the Add this Web site to the zone box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click Add.
Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
Click OK two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. One in particular that you may want to add is "*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" (without the quotation marks). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires using an ActiveX control to install the update.

Temporarily disable the HTML Help ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer
You can help protect against this vulnerability by temporarily disabling the HTML Help ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control.
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
The CLSID for an ActiveX control is a GUID for that control. You can prevent an ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit so that the control is never called by Internet Explorer. The kill bit is a specific value for the Compatibility Flags DWORD value for the ActiveX control in the registry.
The CLSID for the HTML Help ActiveX control is {52a2aaae-085d-4187-97ea-8c30db990436}
For detailed steps about stopping an ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797. Follow these steps and create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent the HTML Help ActiveX control from being instantiated in Internet Explorer
Note If you use this workaround you must reset this registry change by removing the same Compatibility Flags registry value. You should do this after you have applied this security update to regain normal functionality supplied by the HTML Help ActiveX control.
Impact of Workaround: Disabling the HTML Help ActiveX control prevents Internet Explorer from instantiating the control. This configuration causes program compatibility issues. Some examples of such issues are:

In Help and Support Center, the Index feature no longer works.
In HTML Help, features such as Related Topics and Shortcuts no longer work.

Features that are provided by the HTML Help control in Enterprise intranet programs no longer work.
