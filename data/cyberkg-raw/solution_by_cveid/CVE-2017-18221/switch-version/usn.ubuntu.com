Update instructions
The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:
Ubuntu 12.04


linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-trusty
              
              -
              
                3.13.0.149.140






linux-image-3.13.0-149-generic
              
              -
              
                3.13.0-149.199~precise1






linux-image-generic-lts-trusty
              
              -
              
                3.13.0.149.140






linux-image-3.13.0-149-generic-lpae
              
              -
              
                3.13.0-149.199~precise1






Please note that fully mitigating CVE-2018-3639 (Spectre Variant 4)
may require corresponding processor microcode/firmware updates or,
in virtual environments, hypervisor updates. On i386 and amd64
architectures, the SSBD feature is required to enable the kernel
mitigations. BIOS vendors will be making updates available for Intel
processors that implement SSBD. Ubuntu users with a processor from
a different vendor should contact the vendor to identify necessary
firmware updates. Ubuntu users in cloud environments should contact
the cloud provider to confirm that the hypervisor has been updated
to expose the new CPU features to virtual machines.
