Workarounds for Windows Shell Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0063:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Disable the HTML Application Host application.
This vulnerability takes advantage of functionality in the HTML Application Host application. Disabling the association with this application can help prevent attacks using this application. To disable the HTML Application Host application, follow these steps:

Click Start, and then click Run.

Type "%windir%\system32\mshta.exe /unregister" without the quotation marks, and then press ENTER.
Note To reverse these changes, change "/unregister" to "/register".


Impact of Workaround This workaround removes the association between .hta files and the HTML Application Host application. Users who try to load .hta files by double-clicking them in the Windows Shell will be prompted to manually select an application to complete the loading of these file types. This change helps prevent malicious use of the Windows Shell to cause the HTML Application Host application to process other file name extensions.
