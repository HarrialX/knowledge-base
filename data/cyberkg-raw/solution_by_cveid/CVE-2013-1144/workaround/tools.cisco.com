Instructions:
The following identification mechanism exist for this vulnerability.
Embedded Event Manager (EEM)
A Cisco IOS Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policy that is based on Tool Command Language (Tcl) can be used on vulnerable Cisco IOS devices to identify and detect a memory leak that is caused by this vulnerability. The policy allows administrators to monitor the memory for the affected process on a Cisco IOS device. When Cisco IOS EEM detects potential exploitation of this vulnerability, the policy can trigger a response by sending an alert to the network administrator, who could then decide to implement an upgrade or reload the device to recover the lost memory at a suitable time. The example policy is based on a Tcl script that sends a syslog when the memory keeps dropping and reaches EEM_IKE_BUFF_INCR_THRES and when the IKE buffers have dropped EEM_IKE_BUFF_INCR_THRES times. If IKE buffers are freed the counter starts counting from zero. After generating the memory leak syslog the script re-initializes.
The Tcl script is available for download at the "Cisco Beyond: Embedded Event Manager (EEM) Scripting Community" at the following link: https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-30300. A sample device configuration is provided below.
