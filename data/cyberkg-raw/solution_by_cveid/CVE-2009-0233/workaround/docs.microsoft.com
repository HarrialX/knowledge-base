#### Workarounds for DNS Server Vulnerability in WPAD Registration Vulnerability- CVE-2009-0093
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Create a WPAD.DAT Proxy Auto Configuration File on a Host Named WPAD in Your Organization to Direct Web Browsers to Your Organization’s Proxy**
  
    To create a WPAD.DAT proxy auto configuration file, follow these steps:
  
    1.  Create a WPAD.DAT file that adheres to the Proxy auto-config specification. For more information on Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) files including a sample file, see the following [MSDN article](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384240.aspx).  
    2.  Place the WPAD.DAT file in the root directory of a web server in your organization and ensure the file can be requested anonymously.  
    3.  Create a MIME type for the WPAD.DAT file on the web server of "application/x-ns-proxy-autoconfig".  
    4.  Create the appropriate entries in your organizations DHCP or DNS server to allow discovery of the WPAD server.
  
    For information on how to register WPAD, see [Microsoft Knowledgebase Article 934864](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/934864).
  
    **Impact of workaround.** None
