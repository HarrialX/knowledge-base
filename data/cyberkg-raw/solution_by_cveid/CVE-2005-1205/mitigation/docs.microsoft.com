Mitigating Factors for Telnet Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1205:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could only read the session variables for the affected user. This does not include critical data such as password hashes.
All versions of Windows Services for UNIX are vulnerable to this issue only when they are running on Windows 2000. When Windows Services for UNIX is running on other operating systems, it is not vulnerable to this issue.
