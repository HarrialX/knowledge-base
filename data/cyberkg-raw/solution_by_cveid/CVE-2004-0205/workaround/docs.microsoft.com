Workarounds for IIS Redirection Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0205:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

Disable permanent redirects

Open the IIS Configuration manager.
Right-click the Web site that you want to administer, and then click Properties.
Click Home Directory.
Uncheck A permanent redirection for this resource, and then click OK.

Impact of Workaround: The server will no longer perform redirects.

Use URLScan to disallow the use of large requests

Visit the following Web site to Download and install the URLScan security tool.

Start Notepad, and then open the %systemroot%\winnt\urlscan\UrlScan.ini file.

Configure the MaxUrl setting so that it limits requests to 16 kilobytes (KB). To configure the MaxUrl setting to that it limits requests to 16 KB, add the following line to the RequestLimits section of the file:
MaxUrl = 16384

Save, and then close the UrlsScan.ini file.

Start, and then stop the World Wide Web Publishing Service by using the Services item in Control Panel. You can also do this by using the net stop IIsadmin command and the net start w3svc command at a command prompt. For information about how to do this, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 185382


Impact of workaround: The URLScan tool will block all the incoming requests that are larger than 16 KB.

Reduce MaxClientRequestBuffer

Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

Locate the following key in the registry:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\w3svc\parameters

Click Edit, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

Value Name: MaxClientRequestBuffer Type: REG_DWORD


In the DWORD Editor dialog box, under Radix, click Decimal.

In the Data box, type the number of bytes for the maximum URL request. Set the size so that it is equal to or less than 16384 bytes.
Note You must restart the IIS service for the changes to take effect.
For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 260694


Impact of workaround: Any incoming request that is larger than 16384 bytes will fail.

Stop, disable, or remove IIS

You can stop the World Wide Web Publishing Service component of IIS by issuing the net stop w3svc command at a command prompt.
You can use the IIS Manager to disable or stop IIS.
You can stop or disable the World Wide Web Publishing Service by using the Services item in Control Panel.
You can use Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel to remove IIS from your system. To find IIS, click Add/Remove Windows Components.

Impact of Workaround: If you stop the World Wide Web Publishing Service component of IIS, the system can no longer provide Web content. If you stop or remove IIS, the system can no longer provide Web, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), or NTP content. The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) service will also be unavailable.


Yes. The IISLockdown tool installs URLScan, which can be used to block this attack. You must configure the URLScan tool by following the steps that are described in the Workarounds for IIS Redirection Vulnerability section of this bulletin to block this attack.
Will the URLScan tool block this attack?
Yes. You can configure the URLScan tool to block this by following the steps that are described in the Workarounds for IIS Redirection Vulnerability section of this bulletin.
What is redirection?
Redirection occurs when a Web browser makes a request for a Web page that does not exist, and the Web server redirects the browser to another page, such as to a generic error page or to the Web site's home page. For example, the Web page http://www.microsoft.com/xp does not exist, but instead of providing an error, the Web server redirects the browser to a page that suggests pages that the user may have been looking for and provides a site map. This process is redirection.
What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.
Who could exploit the vulnerability?
Any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted message to the affected system could exploit this vulnerability.
How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?
An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted message and sending the message to an affected system, which could then cause the affected system to execute code.
What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?
Systems that have Windows NT 4.0 and IIS 4.0 installed are at risk from this vulnerability. IIS 4.0 is available as part of the Windows NT 4.0 Server Option Pack.
Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?
Yes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability over the Internet.
What does the update do?
The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that IIS 4.0 validates the length of request before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.
When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?
No. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.
When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?
No. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.
Why is there no update available for Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition?
Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack is not supported on Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition. For more information see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 190157.

Verifying Update Installation

Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer
To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. This tool allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site.

File Version Verification
Note Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

Click Start, and then click Search.

In the Search Results pane, click All files and folders under Search Companion.

In the All or part of the file name box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click Search.

In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click Properties.
Note Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.

On the Version tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
Note Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.



Registry Key Verification
You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Hotfix\Q841373\File 1
Note This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 841373 security update into the Windows installation source files.
