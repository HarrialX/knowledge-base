Mitigating Factors for MHTML Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2766:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or instant messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
By default, Outlook Express 6 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone.
The Restricted sites zone helps limit attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing ActiveX Controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the use could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.
By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode mitigates this vulnerability in the e-mail vector because reading e-mail messages in plain text is the default configuration for Outlook Express. See the FAQ section for this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
