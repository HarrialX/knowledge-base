Mitigating Factors for Remote Desktop Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0029
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

For an attack to be successful, a user must visit an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share and open an .rdp file.
The file sharing protocol, Server Message Block (SMB), is often disabled on the perimeter firewall. This limits the potential attack vectors for this vulnerability.
