#### Workarounds for Win32k Double Free Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3941
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Disable the NTVDM subsystem by editing group policy**
  
    Users who do not require NT Virtual DOS Mode (NTVDM), can mitigate exploitation of this vulnerability by disabling the NTVDM subsystem.
  
    To disable the NTVDM subsystem on Windows XP systems:
  
    1.  While logged on with administrator privileges, click **Start**, click **Run**, type **gpedit.msc**, and then click **OK**.  
    2.  In the Group Policy editor's navigation pane, double-click **Administrative Templates**, double-click **Windows Components**, and then click **Application Compatibility**.  
    3.  In the Application Compatibility pane, double-click **Prevent access to 16-bit applications**, change the selection on the Setting tab to **Enabled**, click **OK**, and then exit the Group Policy editor.
  
    For Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 systems, this setting can be deployed by group policy using the same template used for Windows XP systems.
  
    For Windows NT 4.0 systems, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article, [Disabling the MSDOS and WOWEXEC Subsystems on Terminal Server](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/220159).
  
    **Impact of workaround.**  Access to 16-bit applications will be disabled.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**  
  
    To re-enable the NTVDM subsystem on Windows XP systems:
  
    1.  While logged on with administrator privileges, click **Start**, click **Run**, type **gpedit.msc**, and then click **OK**.  
    2.  In the Group Policy editor's navigation pane, double-click **Administrative Templates**, double-click **Windows Components**, and then click **Application Compatibility**.  
    3.  In the Application Compatibility pane, double-click **Prevent access to 16-bit applications**, change the selection on the Setting tab to **Not Configured**, click **OK**, and then exit the Group Policy editor.
  
    For Windows Server 2003, Windows server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 systems, this setting can be deployed by group policy using the same template used for Windows XP systems.
  
    For Windows NT 4.0 systems, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article, [Disabling the MSDOS and WOWEXEC Subsystems on Terminal Server](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/220159).
  
-   **Disable the NTVDM subsystem by editing the system registry**
  
    **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys and Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
  
    **Note** We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.
  
    To disable the NTVDM subsystem by editing the system registry, perform the following steps:
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **regedit**, and then click **OK**.  
    2.  Locate the following key in the system registry:  
        HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\WOW  
    3.  Add a DWORD entry named **DisallowedPolicyDefault** and set its value to **1** (this effectively disables NTVDM).  
    4.  Close Registry Editor.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Access to 16-bit applications will be disabled.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**  
  
    To re-enable the NTVDM subsystem by editing the system registry, follow these steps:
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **regedit**, and then click **OK**.  
    2.  Locate the following key in the system registry:  
        HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\WOW  
    3.  Change the **DisallowedPolicyDefault** value to **0** (this effectively re-enables NTVDM).  
    4.  Close Registry Editor.
