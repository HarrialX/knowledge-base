Workarounds for POSIX Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0210:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

Disable the POSIX subsystem through the registry
This workaround is fully documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 101270. This article is summarized in the following paragraphs.
The following steps demonstrate how to disable the POSIX subsystem.
Note Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
Note We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.

Click Start, click Run, type "regedt32" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

In Registry Editor, locate the following registry key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Subsystems\Posix

Click the POSIX data value, click Edit, and then click Delete.

Click OK to confirm the delete, and then restart the system.
Note To enable the POSIX subsystem, re-create the registry key. The name if the registry key is Posix, the type of registry key is REG_EXPAND_SZ, and the registry key value is %SystemRoot%\system32\psxss.exe. After you have done this, restart the system.


Impact of Workaround: POSIX programs are disabled until the POSIX subsystem is enabled.
