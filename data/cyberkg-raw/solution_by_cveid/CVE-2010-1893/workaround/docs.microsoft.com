#### Workarounds for IPv6 Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1892
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Disable Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) components**
  
    **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 929852](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929852) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution 50444 to disable IPv6 components except for loopback interface. This Fix it solution will require a restart upon completion in order to be effective. This Fix it solution deploys the workaround, and thus has the same user impact. We recommend that administrators review the KB article closely prior to deploying this Fix it solution.
  
    **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, type **regedit** in the **Start Search** box, and then click **regedit.exe** in the **Programs** list.  
    2.  In the **User Account Control** dialog box, click **Continue**.  
    3.  In Registry Editor, locate and then click the following registry subkey:  
        `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip6\Parameters\`  
    4.  Double-click **DisabledComponents** to modify the DisabledComponents entry.  
        **Note** If the DisabledComponents entry is unavailable, you must create it. To do this, follow these steps:  
        a. In the **Edit** menu, point to **New**, and then click **DWORD (32-bit) Value**.  
        b. Type **DisabledComponents**, and then press **ENTER**.  
        c. Double-click **DisabledComponents.**  
    5.  Enter **0xffffffff** to disable all IPv6 components, except the IPv6 loopback interface. This value also configures Windows to use Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) instead of IPv6 in prefix policies.  
    6.  Click **OK**. You must restart your computer for these changes to take effect.
  
    **Impact of workaround.**Routing and Remote Access service will fail after this change goes into effect.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 929852](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929852) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution 50440 to enable IPv6. This Fix it solution will require a restart upon completion in order to be effective.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, type **regedit** in the **Start Search** box, and then click **regedit.exe** in the **Programs** list.  
    2.  In the **User Account Control** dialog box, click **Continue**.  
    3.  In Registry Editor, locate and then click the following registry subkey:  
        `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip6\Parameters\`  
    4.  Delete the **DisabledComponents** entry.  
    5.  You must restart your computer for these changes to take effect.
