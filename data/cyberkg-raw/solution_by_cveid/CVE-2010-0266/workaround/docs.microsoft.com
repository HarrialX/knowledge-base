#### Workarounds for Microsoft Outlook SMB Attachment Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0266
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Do not open e-mail attachments from untrusted sources**
  
    Do not open e-mail attachments from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens an e-mail attachment.
  
-   **Disable the WebClient service**
  
    Disabling the WebClient service helps protect affected systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability by blocking the most likely remote attack vector through the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service. After applying this workaround it will still be possible for remote attackers who successfully exploit this vulnerability to cause Microsoft Office Outlook to run programs located on the targeted user's computer or the Local Area Network (LAN), but users will be prompted for confirmation before opening arbitrary programs from the Internet.
  
    To disable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.  
    2.  Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.  
    3.  Change the Startup type to **Disabled**. If the service is running, click **Stop**.  
    4.  Click **OK** and exit the management application.
  
    **Impact of workaround.**Â When the WebClient service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. In addition, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. For example, WebDAV shares will be inaccessible from the client computer.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    To re-enable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.  
    2.  Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.  
    3.  Change the Startup type to **Automatic**. If the service is not running, click **Start**.  
    4.  Click **OK** and exit the management application.
