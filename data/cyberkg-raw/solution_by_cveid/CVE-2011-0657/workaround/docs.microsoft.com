#### Workarounds for DNS Query Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0657
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Block TCP port 5355 and UDP port 5355 at the firewall**
  
    These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking them at the enterprise firewall, both inbound and outbound, will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312). For more information about the Windows Firewall, see [How to Configure Windows Firewall on a Single Computer](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/smallbusiness/prodtech/windowsxp/cfgfwall.mspx).
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Blocking connectivity to these ports will help prevent systems that are behind the firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.** Unblock TCP port 5355 and UDP port 5355 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
  
-   **Disable Link-Local Mulitcast Name Resolution using group policy**
  
    To disable link-local multicast name resolution using group policy, perform the following steps:
  
    1.  Open the Group Policy Editor.  
    2.  Expand **Computer Configuration**, expand **Administrative Templates**, expand **Network**, and then expand **DNS Client**.  
    3.  Double-click **Turn off Multicast Name Resolution**, click **Enabled**, and then click **OK**.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** The computer may not be visible to other computers on the network.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    To re-enable link-local multicast name resolution using group policy, perform the following steps:
  
    1.  Open the Group Policy Editor.  
    2.  Expand **Computer Configuration**, expand **Administrative Templates**, expand **Network**, and then expand **DNS Client**.  
    3.  Double-click **Turn off Multicast Name Resolution**, click **Disabled**, and then click **OK**.
  
-   **Turn off Network Discovery**
  
    To turn off Network Discover, perform the following steps:
  
    1.  Open the Control Panel.  
    2.  Click **Network and Internet**, click **Network and Sharing Center**, and then click **Change advanced sharing settings**.  
    3.  Under Network Discovery, click **Turn off network discovery**, and then click **Save changes**.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** The computer may not be visible to other computers on the network.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    To re-enable Network Discovery, perform the following steps:
  
    1.  Open the Control Panel.  
    2.  Click Network **and Internet**, click **Network and Sharing Center**, and then click **Change advanced sharing settings**.  
    3.  Under Network Discovery, click **Turn on network discovery**, and then click **Save changes**.
