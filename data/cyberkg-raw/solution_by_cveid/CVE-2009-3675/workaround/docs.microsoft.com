Workarounds for Local Security Authority Subsystem Service Resource Exhaustion Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3675
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Disable the IPsec service
You may disable the IPsec service if not in use.
Note Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

Using the Interactive Method

Click Start, click Run, type Regedit in the Open box, and then click OK.
Expand HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.
Expand System, then CurrentControlSet, then Services.
Click the PolicyAgent key
Create a backup of the registry key by doing the following:
On the File menu, click Export.
In the Export Registry File dialog box, type PolicyAgent_configuration_backup.reg and then click Save.
Under the PolicyAgent key, double click the value named Start.
Change the Value data field to 4.
Click OK.
Run the following command at a command prompt running as an administrator:
net stop PolicyAgent


Using a Managed Deployment Script

Create a backup copy of the registry keys. A backup copy can be made using a managed deployment script with the following command:
regedit /e PolicyAgent_configuration_backup.reg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\PolicyAgent.
Save the following to a file with a .REG extension (e.g. Disable_PolicyAgent.reg):
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\PolicyAgent]
Start"=dword:00000004
Expand System, then CurrentControlSet, then Services.
Click the PolicyAgent key
Create a backup of the registry key by doing the following:
On the File menu, click Export.
In the Export Registry File dialog box, type PolicyAgent_configuration_backup.reg and then click Save.
Run the above registry script created in step 2 on the target system with the following command:
Regedit /s Disable_PolicyAgent.reg
Change the Value data field to 4.
Click OK.
Run the following command at a command prompt running as an administrator on the target system:
net stop PolicyAgent
