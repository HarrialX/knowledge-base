Mitigating Factors for WordPerfect 5.x Converter Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0573:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. A user must open an attachment this is sent in an e-mail message for an attack to be successful through e-mail.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.
This vulnerability does not affect WordPerfect 6.x documents, which are handled by a separate converter (wpft632.cnv).
Office 2003 Service Pack 1 is not affected by this vulnerability.
