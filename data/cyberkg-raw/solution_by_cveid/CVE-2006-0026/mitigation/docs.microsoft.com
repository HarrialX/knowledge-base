Mitigating Factors for Internet Information Services Using Malformed Active Server Pages ASP Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0026:

On IIS 5.0 and IIS 5.1, ASP enabled applications by default run in the 'Pooled Out of Process' application, which means they run in DLLHOST.exe, which is running in the context of the low privilege IWAM_<machinename> account.
By default, IIS 5.1 on Windows XP Professional and IIS 6.0 on Windows Server 2003 are not enabled.
By default, ASP is not enabled on IIS 6.0. If ASP is enabled, it runs in the context of a W3WP.exe worker process running as the low privilege 'NetworkService' account.
An attacker would require valid logon credentials to exploit this vulnerability. However, if a server has been intentionally configured to allow users, either anonymous or authenticated, to upload web content such as .ASP pages to web sites, the server could be attacked successfully by exploiting by this vulnerability.
