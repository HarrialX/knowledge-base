Outlook Web Access for Exchange 2000 Server
Outlook Web Access for Exchange Server 2003



Mitigating factors for cross site scripting attacks

An attacker who successfully exploited the cross-site scripting aspect of this vulnerability would only gain the same privileges as the user when using Outlook Web Access.

Mitigating factors for placing spoofed content in a user’s Web browser cache

Clients who have turned on the Do not save encrypted pages to disk advanced Internet option in Internet Explorer would not be at risk from any attempts to put spoofed content into the client cache if they accessed their Outlook Web Access site through the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

Mitigating factors for placing spoofed content in an intermediate proxy server’s cache

Clients who use SSL-protected connections to access Outlook Web Access would not be vulnerable to attempts to put spoofed content on intermediate proxy server caches. This is because SSL session data is encrypted and is not cached on intermediate proxy servers.
If spoofed content is successfully put in an intermediate proxy server’s cache, it could be difficult for an attacker to predict which users would be served the spoofed cached content.
An attacker must be able to log on to Outlook Web Access to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. If you do not allow anonymous access to Outlook Web Access, only authenticated users could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.
