#### Mitigating Factors for SChannel Spoofing Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0085
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   Customers are only affected when the certificate used for authentication has already been disclosed to the attacker through other means. In the case of an IIS web server, certificates are not transferred in clear text during the authentication process.  
-   Only locally configured user accounts are vulnerable. Customers who map certificate-authenticated users of their application against an Active Directory domain are not affected by this vulnerability.
