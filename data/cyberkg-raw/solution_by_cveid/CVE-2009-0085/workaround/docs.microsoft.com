#### Workarounds for SChannel Spoofing Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0085
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   Customers can implement Active Directory certificate mapping, which is not affected by this vulnerability. Active Directory certificate mapping enables a user with a trusted public key to access domain resources without typing a user name and a password. A client certificate can be directly mapped to an Active Directory user account.  
    For more information on the different ways of configuring certificate mapping, see [Map certificates to user accounts](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc736706.aspx).
