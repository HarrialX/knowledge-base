#### Workarounds for Access Control Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4032
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Block malicious HTTP requests using a firewall**
  
    Configure your firewall, such as Microsoft ISA Server, to block all HTTP requests to your SharePoint site that contain "mode=ssp" in the URL, but do not contain "/ssp/admin/\_layouts" in the URL.
