#### Workarounds for Windows Media Format Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Parsing ASF â€“ CVE-2007-0064
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
The core workaround for these vulnerabilities is to deny access to the vulnerable DLLs on each affected operating system.
  
-   **For client applications deny access to WMASF.DLL**
  
    From an administrative command prompt in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 run the following command:
  
    `Echo y| cacls exe %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\WMASF.DLL  /E /P everyone:N`
  
    From an elevated command prompt in Windows Vista run the following commands:
  
    ```
    Takeown.exe /f %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\WMASF.DLL
    Icacls.exe %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\WMASF.DLL /save %TEMP%\WMASF_ACL.TXT
    Icacls.exe %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\WMASF.DLL /deny everyone:(F)
    ```    
    
    **Impact of Workaround**: Users will be unable to play Advanced Systems Format (ASF) files.
  
-   **For server applications, Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.**
