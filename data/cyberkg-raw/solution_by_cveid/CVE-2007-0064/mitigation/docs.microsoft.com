#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Media Format Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Parsing ASF â€“ CVE-2007-0064
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, which could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   **Mitigating Factors for Client Application:**  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.  
-   Windows Media Player 6.4 when installed on Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Windows Server 2003 is not affected.  
-   **Mitigating Factors for Server Application:**  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the network service account.  
-   Windows Media Services 9.1, which includes wmsserver.dll, is an optional operating system component on all supported 32-bit editions of Windows Server 2003, and x64-based editions of Windows Server 2003.
