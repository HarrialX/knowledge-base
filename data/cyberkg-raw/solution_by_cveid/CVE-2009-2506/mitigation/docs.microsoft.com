Mitigating Factors for WordPad and Office Text converter Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2506
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative privileges.
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
A Web site that is being used to attempt to exploit the vulnerability would cause a dialog box to appear. The user would be prompted to open the file or not, unless the user had previously unchecked the option, "Always ask before opening this type of file".
