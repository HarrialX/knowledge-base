#### Workarounds for Remote Desktop Protocol Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1968
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Disable Terminal Services, Remote Desktop, Remote Assistance, and Windows Small Business Server 2003 Remote Web Workplace feature if no longer required**
  
    If you no longer need these services on your system, consider disabling them as a security best practice. Disabling unused and unneeded services helps reduce your exposure to security vulnerabilities.
  
    For information about how to disable Remote Desktop manually, see [To disable Remote Desktop](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/rdesktop_disable.mspx).
  
    For information about how to disable Remote Desktop by using Group Policy, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306300](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306300).
  
    For information about Remote Assistance, including instructions on how to disable Remote Assistance manually and by using Group Policy, see the TechNet article, [Remote Assistance](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb457177.aspx).
  
    For information about how to disable the Windows Small Business Server 2003 Terminal Services and Remote Web Workplace features, see the TechNet article, [Securing Your Windows Small Business Server 2003 Network](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/secnews/articles/sec_sbs2003_network.mspx).
  
-   **Block TCP port 3389 at the enterprise perimeter firewall**
  
    This port is used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking it at the network perimeter firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. This can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Blocking the affected ports at the enterprise perimeter is the best defense to help avoid Internet-based attacks. However, systems could still be vulnerable to attacks from within their enterprise perimeter. Additionally, on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, the Windows Firewall can help protect individual systems. By default, the Windows Firewall does not allow connections to this port, except in Windows XP Service Pack 2 when the Remote Desktop feature is enabled. For information about how to disable the Windows Firewall exception for Remote Desktop on these platforms, see the TechNet article, [Enable or Disable the Remote Desktop Firewall Rule](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc736451(ws.10).aspx). If you cannot disable the Windows Firewall exception for Remote Desktop, you may be able to reduce the scope of this vulnerability by setting the default value of All computers (Including those on the Internet), to the local network. Doing this helps reduce the likelihood of attacks from the Internet.
    
    **Note** Windows Small Business Server 2003 uses a feature named Remote Web Workplace. This feature uses TCP port 4125 to listen for RDP connections. If you are using this feature, you should validate that this port is also blocked from the Internet in addition to port 3389.
    
    **Note** It is possible to manually change the affected components to use other ports. If you have performed these actions, you should also block those additional ports.
