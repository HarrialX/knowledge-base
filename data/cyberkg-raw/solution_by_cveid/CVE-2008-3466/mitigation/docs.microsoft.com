#### Mitigating Factors for HIS Command Execution Vulnerability - CVE- 2008-3466
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the SNA service account as specified during the install of Host Integration Server. Customers who follow best practices and configure the SNA RPC service account to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than customers who configure the SNA service account to have administrative user rights.  
-   For systems with Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 Administrator Client or the Microsoft Host Integration Server 2004 Client, the default installation does not create or start the SNA Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service where the vulnerability exists. However; the files are installed by default and can be started therefore we highly recommend that customers apply the update if they have a vulnerable version of the product.
