Workarounds for Word Stack Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3214
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations
The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.
Note Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.
For Office 2003 
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]

"BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000

Note In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2003, all of the latest security updates for Microsoft Office 2003 must be applied.
For Office 2007
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]

"BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000

Note In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with the 2007 Microsoft Office system, all of the latest security updates for the 2007 Microsoft Office system must be applied.
For Office 2010 
Open Word 2010 and follow the steps below:

Click the File tab.
Under Help, click Options.
Click TrustCenter, and then click Trust Center Settings.
In the Trust Center, click File Block Settings.
Ensure the Open check box is selected for the following file types:

Word 2003 Binary Documents and Templates
Word XP Binary Documents and Templates
Word 2000 Binary Documents and Templates
Word 97 Binary Documents and Templates
Word 95 Binary Documents and Templates
Word 6.0 Binary Documents and Templates
Word 2 and earlier Binary Documents and Templates


Under Open behavior for selected file types, select "Do not open selected file types" or select "Open selected file types in Protected View" (either choice will block the attack vector to the vulnerable code).
Click OK to apply the File Block Settings.

Alternatively, file block can be applied using Group Policy. For more information, see the TechNet article, Plan file block settings for Office 2010.
Impact of workaround. For Microsoft Office 2003 and Microsoft Office 2007, users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special "exempt directory" as discussed in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848 will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions. For Microsoft Office 2007, Office 2003 or earlier versions will either be blocked from opening or will be opened in protected mode depending on the open behavior that was selected.
How to undo the workaround.

Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources
The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) helps protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.
To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or Office 2007 installed.
To install MOICE, you must also have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the Microsoft Download Center:
Download the FileFormatConverters.exe package now
MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit Microsoft Update to install all recommended updates:
http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx?ln=en-us
Enable MOICE
Note See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865 to use the automated Microsoft Fix it solution to enable or disable this workaround.
To manually enable MOICE, run the commands as specified in the following table. Running the commands will associate the Office application extensions with MOICE.



Command to enable MOICE to be the registered handler    




For Word, run the following command from a command prompt:    
ASSOC .doc=oice.word.document    


For Excel, run the following commands from a command prompt:    
ASSOC .XLS=oice.excel.sheet    
ASSOC .XLT=oice.excel.template    
ASSOC .XLA=oice.excel.addin    


For PowerPoint, run the following commands from a command prompt:    
ASSOC .PPT=oice.powerpoint.show    
ASSOC .POT=oice.powerpoint.template    
ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow    



Note On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, run the above commands from an elevated command prompt.
For more information on MOICE, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865.
Impact of workaround. Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the Microsoft Office 2007 Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.
How to undo the workaround. Run the commands to disable MOICE as specified in the table below.



Command to disable MOICE as the registered handler    




For Word, run the following command from a command prompt:    
ASSOC .doc=Word.Document.8    


For Excel, run the following commands from a command prompt:    
ASSOC .xls=Excel.Sheet.8    
ASSOC .xlt=Excel.Template    
ASSOC .xla=Excel.Addin
