Workarounds for LSASS Recursive Stack Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1928
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Block TCP ports 389, 636, 3268 and 3269 at the firewall
Block the following at the firewall:
TCP ports 389, 636, 3268 and 3269
These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking them at the enterprise firewall, both inbound and outbound, will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Ports 389 and 636 provide LDAP and secure LDAP services respectively, while ports 3268 and 3269 are used by the Global Catalog server which also processes LDAP requests. Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM) and Active Directory Lightweight Directory Service (ADÂ LDS) allow administrators to configure LDAP ports which are non-default. When applying this workaround, those ports should be blocked at the firewall as well in order to prevent exploitation.
Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports.
