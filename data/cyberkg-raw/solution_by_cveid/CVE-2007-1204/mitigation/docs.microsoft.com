Mitigating Factors for UPnP Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-1204:

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run code in the context of the Local Service account only and could not run code under the Local SYSTEM account.
By default the UPnP service is set to manual on affected systems.
Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
