Workarounds for Exchange Server Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0560:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.
Use SMTP protocol inspection to filter out SMTP protocol extensions.
There are default ISA publishing rules for Exchange for filtering out any SMTP protocol extensions from traffic that passes the firewall. Other third-party products may offer similar functionality. More information on how to publish an Exchange server computer with ISA Server can be found by visiting the Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 311237.
Only accept authenticated SMTP sessions.
If practical, accept only authenticated connections. Accepting connections only from trusted sources will prevent anonymous attackers from being able to exploit this issue.
To require SMTP authentication on an Exchange 2000 server:

Start Exchange System Manager.
Locate the server in the organization tree.
Expand the Protocols container for the server.
Expand the SMTP container.
For each SMTP virtual server:


Open the properties and of the virtual server object.
Click the Access properties page.
Click the Authentication button.
Clear the "Anonymous Access" checkbox.
Click OK to accept the change.

Impact of Workaround:
Typically, inbound SMTP mail is accepted without requiring authentication from the sender. If you implement this workaround, you will be able to receive email only from senders who have been granted appropriate permissions in your system.
Note This workaround does not prevent a malicious authenticated user from exploiting this vulnerability. But it does protect you against attack by anonymous users.
Use a firewall to block the port that SMTP uses.
Use a firewall to block the port that SMTP uses. Typically, that is port 25.
Impact of Workaround:
This workaround should only be used as a last resort to help protect you from this vulnerability. This workaround may directly affect the ability to communicate with external parties by e-mail.
Unregister xlsasink.dll and fallback to Active Directory for distribution of route information.
This workaround is presented for those operating a single-server Exchange organization. In organizations with more than one server, this option can cause problems, including, but not limited to misrouted e-mail.

In the exchange installation’s bin directory, run regsvr32 /u xlsasink.dll.
If the default one hour interval for the Exchange servers to update routing information from AD is sufficient, you may skip to step 8. Otherwise continue with the following instructions, taken from the More Information section in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 842026
Run regedit.
Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RESvc\Parameters
Edit the ReloadOsInterval value. If it doesn’t exist, create a new DWORD with that name.
Type in the number of seconds that the AD route information refresh interval should be. By default this is 3600.
Click Ok and close regedit
Restart all of the Exchange servers in the Routing Group at the same time.

Impact of Workaround:
Exchange Servers will not use SMTP to proactively update routing information. They will, however, continue to use Routing Engine port 691 within a Routing Group (RG). If changes to the mail infrastructure outside of the RG are made, the Exchange servers will not know about the new configuration until they refresh routing information from the Active Directory. If this process does not occur, or takes too long, it will result in an interruption of mail services. The only way for this process to occur is if Winroute shows a zero value for the major version of all remote routing groups (See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 842026 for more information). For this reason, if you chose to implement this workaround, please contact Microsoft Product Support Services if you have more than one Exchange server in your organization. Information on how to contact Microsoft Product Support Services can be found at at this Web site.
Note This workaround should only be considered as a short term mitigation step to be used until the update can be applied. It is highly likely that over time message routing problems will arise by operating in this state. Please apply the security update as soon as possible and reverse all changes made.
