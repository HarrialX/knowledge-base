Mitigating Factors for Exchange Server Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0560:
Exchange Server 2003 will not process commands of this type that originate from unauthenticated users. The level of authentication required to exploit this vulnerability is typically only granted to other Exchange Servers within the same organization.
Microsoft ISA Server 2000, or third-party products that relay and filter SMTP traffic before forwarding it to Exchange, could be used to prevent an attack over the Internet. Detailed instructions on how to help protect against an attack using ISA Server can be found at the ISA Server Preventative Measures Web site by following the link “Help Protect Against the Exchange Server Vulnerability for MS05-021 Traffic”.
Customers who use ISA Server 2000 or ISA Server 2004 to publish Exchange SMTP services with the default SMTP publishing rules are at reduced risk from this attack over the Internet. The Workarounds section below discusses these ISA publishing rules.
