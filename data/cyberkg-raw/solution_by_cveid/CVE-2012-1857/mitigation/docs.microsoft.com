Mitigating Factors for Dynamics AX Enterprise Portal XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1857
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website and then convince them to click a specially crafted URL that is used to exploit the vulnerability.
Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 users browsing to a Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Enterprise Portal site in the Internet Zone are at a reduced risk. By default, the XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 prevents this attack in the Internet Zone. The XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9, however, is not enabled by default in the Intranet Zone.
The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through email. For an attack to be successful, a user must click a specially crafted URL that is sent in an email message.
