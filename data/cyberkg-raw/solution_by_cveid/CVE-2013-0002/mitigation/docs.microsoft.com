Mitigating Factors for WinForms Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2013-0002
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
By default, Internet Explorer 9 and Internet Explorer 10 prevent XAML, which is used by XBAPs, from running in the Internet Zone.
By default, Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8 are configured to prompt the user before running XAML, which is used by XBAPs in the Internet Zone.
