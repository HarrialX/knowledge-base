Workarounds for ART Image Rendering Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2378:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Modify the Access Control List on the AOL ART files to temporarily prevent them from being displayed in Internet Explorer
To modify the Access Control List (ACL) on the AOL ART files to be more restrictive, follow these steps:

Click Start, click Run, type cmd, and then click OK.

Type the following commands at a command prompt. Make a note of the current files ACLs, including inheritance settings. You may need this list if you have to undo these modifications:
cacls %windir%\system32\jgdw400.dll
cacls %windir%\system32\jgpl400.dll

Type the following command at a command prompt to deny the ‘everyone’ group access to this file:
echo y|cacls %windir%\system32\jgdw400.dll /d everyone
echo y|cacls %windir%\system32\jgpl400.dll /d everyone

Close Internet Explorer, and reopen it for the changes to take effect.
Impact of Workaround: Applications and Web sites that contain AOL ART files will no longer display those images.
To regain functionality, you must undo the modifications to the Access Control List on the AOL ART files.



Install Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-021, Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (916281)
After installation of Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-021: Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (916281), ART files will no longer be displayed in Internet Explorer.
