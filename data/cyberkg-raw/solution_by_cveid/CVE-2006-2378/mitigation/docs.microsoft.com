Mitigating Factors for ART Image Rendering Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2378:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or instant messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
Windows 2000 does not support AOL ART images by default. Windows 2000 is only affected if the Windows 2000 AOL Image Support Update has been installed. The files being updated with this security update does not exist on a Windows 2000 system without this AOL Image Support Update.
