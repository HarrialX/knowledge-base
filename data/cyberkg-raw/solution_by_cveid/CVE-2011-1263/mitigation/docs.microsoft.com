#### Mitigating Factors for Remote Desktop Web Access Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1263
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   The XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 prevents this attack for its users when browsing to a Remote Desktop Web Access server in the Internet Zone. The XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 is not enabled by default in the Intranet Zone.  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.  
-   Remote Desktop Web Access is not installed by default. You must install the Remote Desktop Web Access role service on the server that you want users to connect to over the Web to access RemoteApp programs. When you install Remote Desktop Web Access, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) is also installed as a required component.
