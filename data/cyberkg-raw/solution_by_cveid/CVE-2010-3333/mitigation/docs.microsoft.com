Mitigating Factors for PowerPoint Integer Underflow Causes Heap Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2573
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted PowerPoint file.

Mitigating Factors for RTF Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3333
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

Mitigating Factors for Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3337
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

For an attack to be successful using an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share, a user must be convinced to open a PowerPoint presentation located on the remote file system location or WebDAV share. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share.
The file sharing protocol SMB is often disabled on the perimeter firewall. This limits the potential attack vectors.
