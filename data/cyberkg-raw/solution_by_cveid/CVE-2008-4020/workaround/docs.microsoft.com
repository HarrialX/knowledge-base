Workarounds for Vulnerability in Content-Disposition Header Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4020
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Disable CDO protocol handler
Disabling the affected protocol will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To disable the affected service, unregister these three registry keys:
'HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\PROTOCOLS\Handler\cdo'
'HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\CDO'
'HKCR\PROTOCOLS\Handler\cdo'
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
Note We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.
