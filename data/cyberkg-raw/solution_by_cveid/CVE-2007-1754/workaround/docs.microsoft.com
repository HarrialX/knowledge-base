#### Workarounds for Publisher Invalid Memory Reference Vulnerability – CVE-2007-1754
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.  
-   Modify Access Control List on pubconv.dll
  
    To modify the Access Control List (ACL) on pubconv.dll to be more restrictive, follow these steps:
  
1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "cmd" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.  
2.  Type the following command at a command prompt. Make a note of the current ACLs that are on the file (including inheritance settings) for future reference in case you have to undo this modification:  
    **cacls \\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\Office12\\pubconv.dll**  
3.  Type the following command at a command prompt to deny the ‘everyone’ group access to this file:  
    **cacls \\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\Office12 /d everyone**
  
    **Impact of Workaround:** Applications that require the use of previous editions of Publisher documents may no longer function correctly.
