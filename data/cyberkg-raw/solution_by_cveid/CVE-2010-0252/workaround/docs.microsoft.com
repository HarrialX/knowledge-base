#### Workarounds for Microsoft Data Analyzer ActiveX Control Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0252
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Enable or disable ActiveX Controls in Office 2007**
  
    To reduce the possibility of this vulnerability being exploited through an Office 2007 document using an ActiveX control, follow the steps below to disable ActiveX controls within Office documents. For more information about disabling ActiveX controls in Office 2007, see the Microsoft Office Online article, [Enable or disable ActiveX controls in Office documents](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/ha100310671033.aspx).
  
    Open the Trust Center in Office 2007 applications using one of the following methods. Once you have selected the **ActiveX Settings**, select **Disable all controls without notification**, and then click **OK**.
  
    **Note** If you change an ActiveX control setting in one Office application, the settings are also changed in all the other Office programs on your computer.
  
    **Excel**
  
    Click the **Microsoft Office** button, select **Excel Options**, select **TrustCenter**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **Outlook**
  
    From the **Tools** menu, select **TrustCenter**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **PowerPoint**
  
    Click the **Microsoft Office** button, select **PowerPoint Options**, select **Trust Center**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **Word**
  
    Click the **Microsoft Office** button, select **Word Options**, select **Trust Center**, select **TrustCenter Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **Access**
  
    Click the **Microsoft Office** button, select **Access Options**, select **Trust Center**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **InfoPath**
  
    From the **Tools** menu, select **Trust Center**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **Publisher**
  
    From the **Tools** menu, select **Trust Center**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **Visio**
  
    From the **Tools** menu, select **Trust Center**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** ActiveX controls will not be instantiated in Microsoft Office applications.
  
-   **Prevent COM objects from running in Internet Explorer**
  
    You can disable attempts to instantiate a COM object in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.
  
    **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
  
    For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797).
