Instructions:
If a hardware upgrade is an option, a possible workaround would be to use VWIC3-T1/E1 or HWIC-T1/E1 interface cards instead of the VWIC2 interface card.
Alternatively, if the T1/E1 controller is configured for clock source line, and only a single channel-group is configured under controller, a possible workaround is to configure clock source line independent.


The following identification mechanism exist for this vulnerability.


Embedded Event Manager (EEM)
 
A Cisco IOS Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policy that is based on Tool Command Language (Tcl) can be used on vulnerable Cisco IOS devices to identify and detect an interface queue wedge that is caused by this vulnerability. The policy allows administrators to monitor the interfaces for Cisco IOS devices and detect when the interface input queues are full. When Cisco IOS EEM detects potential exploitation of this vulnerability, the policy can trigger a response by sending an alert to the network administrator, who could then decide to implement an upgrade, implement suitable mitigations or reload the device to clear the input queue.

The Tcl script is available for download at the "Cisco Beyond: Embedded Event Manager (EEM) Scripting Community" at the following link: https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-19337
