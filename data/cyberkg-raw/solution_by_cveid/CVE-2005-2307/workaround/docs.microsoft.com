Workarounds for Network Connection Manager Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2307:

Block the following at the enterprise perimeter firewall:

UDP ports 135, 137, 138, and 445, and TCP ports 135, 139, 445, and 593
All unsolicited inbound traffic on ports greater than 1024
Any other specifically configured RPC port
If installed, COM Internet Services (CIS) or RPC over HTTP, which listen on ports 80 and 443
These ports could be used to initiate a connection with affected systems. Blocking them at the firewall will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Also, make sure that you block any other specifically configured RPC port on the remote system. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports that RPC uses, visit the following Web site. For more information about how to disable CIS, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 825819.
