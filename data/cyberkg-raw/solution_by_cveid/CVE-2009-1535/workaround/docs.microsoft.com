#### Workarounds for IIS 5.0 WebDAV Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1122
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Disable WebDAV**
  
    If WebDAV functionality is not required on the server, it can be disabled.
  
    For IIS 5.0, WebDAV can be disabled as described in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 241520](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/241520).
  
    **Impact of workaround.** After applying this workaround, WebDAV requests will not be served by IIS.
  
-   **Alternate method to disable WebDAV on IIS 5.0**
  
    The [IIS Lockdown Tool 2.1](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=dde9efc0-bb30-47eb-9a61-fd755d23cdec&displaylang=en) can be used to disable WebDAV as well. See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 325864](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/325864).
  
    -   To start the installation immediately, click **Open** or **Run this program from its current location**.  
    -   To copy the download to your computer for installation at a later time, click **Save** or **Save this program to disk**.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** This method achieves its results by installing [UrlScan](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc242650.aspx). By default, UrlScan blocks requests to WebDAV by detecting either HTTP verbs or headers that would be mapped to WebDAV. If the IIS Lockdown tool is uninstalled, UrlScan will remain. To uninstall UrlScan, unregister the UrlScan ISAPI filter from the IIS Manager snap-in.
  
-   **Change file system ACLs to deny access to the anonymous user accoun**t
  
    If WebDAV functionality is required, NTFS ACLs should be used to control access to resources on the server. If resources should be inaccessible to the anonymous user through WebDAV, appropriate read or write NTFS ACLs should be applied based on desired access to that resource. For more information on setting ACLs for IIS content, see the following articles:

    -   [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 812614](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/812614/)
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Applying this workaround may have adverse effects on products that require content to be accessed by the IUSR\_<computername> account. Examples of these products include System Center Configuration Manager 2007.
  
#### Workarounds for IIS 5.1 and 6.0 WebDAV Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1535
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Disable WebDAV**
  
    If WebDAV functionality is not required on the server, it can be disabled.
  
    For IIS 5.0 and IIS 5.1, WebDAV can be disabled as described in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 241520](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/241520).
  
    For IIS 6.0, WebDAV can be disabled using the following steps:
  
    1.  Launch the IIS Manager MMC snap-in.  
    2.  In the left-hand pane, expand the local computer icon.  
    3.  Click on **Web Service Extensions** beneath this item.  
    4.  In the right-hand pane, select **WebDAV** and click the **Prohibit** button.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** After applying this workaround, WebDAV requests will not be served by IIS.
  
-   **Alternate method to disable WebDAV on IIS 5.1 and IIS 6.0**
  
    Microsoft UrlScan Filter v3.1 can be used to disable WebDAV as well.
  
    For IIS 5.1 and IIS 6.0, download Microsoft UrlScan Filter v3.1 from one of the following:
  
    -   For 32-bit systems: [Microsoft Urlscan Filter v3.1 (x86)](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=ee41818f-3363-4e24-9940-321603531989&displaylang=en)  
    -   For x64-based systems: [Microsoft Urlscan Filter v3.1 (x64)](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=361e5598-c1bd-46b8-b3e7-3980e8bdf0de&displaylang=en)
  
    Then do one of the following:
  
    -   To start the installation immediately, click **Open** or **Run this program from its current location**.  
    -   To copy the download to your computer for installation at a later time, click **Save** or **Save this program to disk**.
