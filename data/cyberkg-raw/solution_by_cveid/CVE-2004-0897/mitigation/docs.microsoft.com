Mitigating Factors for Indexing Service Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0897:

The Indexing Service is not enabled by default on the affected systems.
Even when the Indexing Service is installed, by default it is not accessible from Internet Information Services (IIS). Manual steps are required to enable (IIS) to become a Web-based interface for the Indexing Service. By default the Indexing Service is used only to perform local and remote file system queries. Web-based query pages must be created or installed manually that will allow IIS to receive queries from anonymous users and pass those queries to the Indexing Service.
Only users with permissions to access the manually created or installed queries pages would be able to attempt to exploit this vulnerability through IIS. If these Web-based query pages require authenticated access, anonymous users would not be able to exploit this vulnerable through IIS.
If none of the Web-based query methods have been manually enabled, only authenticated users would be able to attempt to exploit this vulnerability through remote file system queries.
Windows 2000 is not affected by this vulnerability. However the additional security-related change does affect Windows 2000 and we recommend customers install this update.
Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
