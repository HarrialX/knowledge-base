Mitigating Factors for WebDAV Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0718:

The vulnerability can only be exploited remotely if an attacker can establish a Web session with an affected server.
By default, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, except for Windows Server 2003 Web Server Edition, do not install IIS.
IIS 5.0, which is included as part of Windows 2000, is the only version that enables WebDAV by default
