#### Workarounds for Oracle Outside In Contains Multiple Exploitable Vulnerabilities
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Disable WebReady document view**
  
    1.  Log in to the Exchange Management Shell as an Exchange Organization Administrator.  
    2.  Issue the following PowerShell command:     
Get-OwaVirtualDirectory | where {$_.OwaVersion -eq 'Exchange2007' -or $_.OwaVersion -eq 'Exchange2010'} |  
Set-OwaVirtualDirectory -WebReadyDocumentViewingOnPublicComputersEnabled:$False -  
WebReadyDocumentViewingOnPrivateComputersEnabled:$False

**Impact of workaround.**Â OWA users may not be able to preview the content of email attachments.

**How do I undo the workaround?**

1.  Log in to the Exchange Management Shell as an Exchange Organization Administrator.  
2.  Issue the following PowerShell command:  

Get-OwaVirtualDirectory | where {$_.OwaVersion -eq 'Exchange2007' -or $_.OwaVersion -eq 'Exchange2010'} |  
Set-OwaVirtualDirectory -WebReadyDocumentViewingOnPublicComputersEnabled:$True -  
WebReadyDocumentViewingOnPrivateComputersEnabled:$True

Note The above steps assume the Exchange Administrator had previously allowed WebReady Documents to be viewed on both Public and Private logons to OWA. The appropriate $True or $False value should be used to set the desired behavior based upon user logon.
