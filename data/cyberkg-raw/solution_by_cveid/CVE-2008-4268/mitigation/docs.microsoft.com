#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Saved Search Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4268
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open and save an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a specially crafted saved-search (.search-ms) file. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Attempts to exploit this vulnerability require user interaction.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.  
-   Users running Internet Explorer 7 will be prompted by a dialog box indicating a web page is attempting to open content in Windows Explorer. This dialog box prompts the user to "Allow" or "Don't Allow" the content, but also allows users to not display messages of this type again. Users who have previously selected "Do not show me the warning for this program again" for Windows Explorer will not receive this prompt.
  
#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Search Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4269
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a specially crafted Windows Search (search-ms://) URL. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Attempts to exploit this vulnerability require user interaction.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.  
-   Customers who are running Internet Explorer 7 with default settings will receive a pop-up warning asking users if they want to allow the web page to communicate with Windows Explorer. The default setting is to not allow the communication.  
-   Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 systems will display a warning dialog before executing a program from outside of the intranet. This warning will not be displayed if the attacker tries to reference and executable within the intranet or on the targetâ€™s machine.
