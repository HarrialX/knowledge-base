Administrators can mitigate these vulnerabilities limiting access to TCP ports 2000 and 2443 to only allow traffic from networks that require SCCP access to Cisco Unified Communications Manager appliances.
Additional mitigation techniques that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this advisory:
