#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Jet Engine MDB File Parsing Stack Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2007-6026
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a specially crafted Word file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's site.  
-   Systems that use Microsoft Outlook 2003 and 2007 as their e-mail client can mitigate the HTML email vector for Outlook 2007 by configuring mail to be read in plain text only.  
-   Systems running all supported editions of Windows XP Service Pack 3, Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008 are not affected by this vulnerability.
