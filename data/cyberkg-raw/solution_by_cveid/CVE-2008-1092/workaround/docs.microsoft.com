#### Workarounds for Microsoft Jet Engine MDB File Parsing Stack Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2007-6026  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Restrict the Microsoft Jet Database Engine from running for any application**  
    To implement the workaround, enter the following command at a command prompt:
  
    `echo y| cacls "%SystemRoot%\system32\msjet40.dll" /E /P everyone:N`
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Any application requiring the use of the Microsoft Jet Database Engine to make data access calls will not function.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.** Enter the following command at a command prompt
  
    `echo y| cacls "%SystemRoot%\system32\msjet40.dll" /E /R everyone`
  
-   **Use group policy to restrict the Microsoft Jet Database Engine from running for any application**  
To implement the workaround, perform the following steps:
  
    1.  Create the following script, named JetCacls.cmd for illustration:  
        
        @echo off  
        if exist %systemdrive%\\Cacls.log goto end  
        cacls "%SystemRoot%\\system32\\msjet40.dll" /E /P everyone:N > nul 2>&1  
        echo %date% %time%: Msjet Cacls updated > %systemdrive%\\Cacls.log  
        :end  
        exit  
    2.  Copy JetCacls.cmd to the Netlogon shared folder, or another shared folder on the domain controller from which JetCacls.cmd would run.  
    3.  Set up JetCacls.cmd. In the **Active Directory Users and Computers MMC** snap-in, right-click the domain name, and then click **Properties**.  
    4.  Click the **Group Policy** tab.  
    5.  Click **New** to create a new Group Policy object (GPO), and enter JetCacls for the name of the policy.  
    6.  Click the new policy, and then click **Edit**.  
    7.  Expand **Windows Settings for Computer Configuration**, and then click **Scripts**.  
    8.  Double-click **Logon**, and then click **Add**. The Add a Script dialog box appears.  
    9.  Type \\\\s*ervername*\\s*harename*\\JetCacls.cmd in the Script Name box.  
    10. Click **OK**, and then click **Apply**.  
    11. Then restart the client computers that are members of this domain.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Any application that requires the use of the Microsoft Jet Database Engine to make data access calls will not function. This restriction only applies to applications that are running on client computers in the domain.
  
-   **Block MDB files from being processed through your mail infrastructure**  
**Note** All Jet database files should be treated as unsafe file types for common users and Microsoft recommends that database files transferred via e-mail be treated as suspicious.
  
    To implement this workaround, your mail environment must support the ability to search for attachments containing a specific file structure (not just the file extension) within an e-mail message and then perform actions on the attachment such as delete, quarantine, notify, and report the detected file.
  
    To detect Jet files that have possibly been renamed to another file type, search for files with any of the following 15-byte signatures at location 0x4 (no quotes):
  
    ```
    "Jet System DB "
    "Standard Jet DB"
    "Temp Jet DB "
    ```
  
    For configurations specific to Microsoft Exchange customers using Forefront (formerly Antigen) technologies, please see [Microsoft Forefront Server Security: File Filtering](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb795068.aspx) for more information.
  
    This information has been shared with members of [Microsoft Security Response Alliance](http://www.microsoft.com/security/msra/default.mspx). To utilize the MSRA tools to detect MDB files, please contact the providers as listed on the MSRA home page.
  
    **Impact of Workaround.** Files detected by this configuration will be blocked from processing through an organizationâ€™s e-mail system.
  
-   Configure Outlook 2007 to read mail in plain text.  
-   Do not open or save Jet or Microsoft Word files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.
