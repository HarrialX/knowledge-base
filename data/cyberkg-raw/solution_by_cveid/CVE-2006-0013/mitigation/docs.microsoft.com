Mitigating Factors for Web Client Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0013:

An attacker must have valid logon credentials to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely by anonymous users. However, the affected component is available remotely to users who have standard user accounts. In certain configurations, anonymous users could authenticate as the Guest account. For more information, see Microsoft Security Advisory 906574.
By default, the Web Client service is disabled in Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1. An administrator would have to manually enable this service for the system to become vulnerable to this issue.
Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. By default, the Internet Connection Firewall that is provided as part of Windows XP Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2003 blocks the affected ports from responding to network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability.
