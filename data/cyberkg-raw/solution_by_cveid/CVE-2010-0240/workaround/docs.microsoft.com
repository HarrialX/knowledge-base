#### Workarounds for ICMPv6 Router Advertisement Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0239
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Disable the "Core Networking – Router Advertisement (ICMPv6-In)" inbound firewall rule**
  
    To disable this firewall rule, run the following command from an elevated command prompt:
  
    `netsh advfirewall firewall set rule name="Core Networking – Router Advertisement (ICMPv6-In)" dir=in new enable=No`
  
    **Impact of workaround.** ICMPv6 router advertisements will be blocked. This could adversely impact IPv6 functionality in common deployment scenarios, where router discovery protocol is used for host configuration.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    To re-enable this firewall rule, run the following command from an elevated command prompt:
  
    `netsh advfirewall firewall set rule name="Core Networking – Router Advertisement (ICMPv6-In)" dir=in new enable=Yes`
  
#### Workarounds for Header MDL Fragmentation Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0240
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature**
  
    To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature. You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 309798](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309798).
