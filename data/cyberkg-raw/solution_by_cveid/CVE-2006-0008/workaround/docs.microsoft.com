Workarounds for Korean IME Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0008:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known remote attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Disable Terminal Services, Remote Desktop, Remote Assistance, and Windows Small Business Server 2003 Remote Web Workplace if they are no longer required.
If you no longer need these services on your system, consider disabling them as a security best practice. Disabling unused and unneeded services helps reduce your exposure to security vulnerabilities.
For information about how to disable Remote Desktop manually, visit the following Web site.
For information about how to disable Remote Desktop by using Group Policy, see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base Article.
For information about Remote Assistance, including instructions on how to disable Remote Assistance manually and by using Group Policy, visit the following Web site.

Block TCP port 3389 at the enterprise perimeter firewall.
This port is used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking it at the network perimeter firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. This can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Blocking the affected ports at the enterprise perimeter is the best defense to help avoid Internet-based attacks. However, systems could still be vulnerable to attacks from within their enterprise perimeter. Additionally, on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, Windows Firewall can help protect individual systems. By default, Windows Firewall does not allow connections to this port, except in Windows XP Service Pack 2 when the Remote Desktop feature is enabled. For information about how to disable the Windows Firewall exception for Remote Desktop on these platforms, visit the following Web site. If you cannot disable the Windows Firewall exception for Remote Desktop, you may be able to reduce the scope of this vulnerability by setting the default value of All computers (Including those on the Internet), to the local network. Doing this helps reduce the likelihood of attacks from the Internet.
Note Windows Small Business Server 2003 uses a feature named Remote Web Workplace. This feature uses TCP port 4125 for RDP connections, but only once a user has been successfully authenticated. If you are using this feature, you should validate that this port is also blocked from the Internet in addition to port 3389.
Note It is possible to manually change the affected components to use other ports. If you have performed these actions, you should also block those additional ports.

Help secure Remote Desktop connections by using an IPsec policy.
Specific configurations would be dependent upon the individual environment. For information about Internet Protocol Security (IPsec), visit the following Web site. Detailed information about IPsec and about how to apply filters is available in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190 and Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878.

Help secure Remote Desktop connections by using a virtual private network (VPN) connection.
Specific configurations depend on the individual environment. For information about Virtual Private Networks, visit the following Web site.
