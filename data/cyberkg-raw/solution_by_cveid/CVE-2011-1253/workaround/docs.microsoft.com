Workarounds for .NET Framework Class Inheritance Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1253
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Disable XAML browser applications in Internet Explorer
To help protect against this vulnerability, change your settings to prompt before running XAML browser applications (XBAPs) or to disable XBAPs in the Internet and Local intranet security zones as follows:

In Internet Explorer, click the Tools menu and then select Internet Options.
Click the Security tab, click Internet, and then click Custom level. Under Settings, for Loose XAML, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.
Click the Security tab, click Internet, and then click Custom level. Under Settings, for XAML browser applications, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.
Click the Security tab, click Internet, and then click Custom level. Under Settings, for XPS documents, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.
On the Security tab, click Custom level. Under .NET Framework-reliant components, set Run components not signed with Authenticode to either Prompt or Disable, and then click OK. Repeat this step for Run components signed with Authenticode, and then click OK.
Click Local intranet, and then click Custom Level. Repeat steps 3 and 4. If you are prompted to confirm that you want to change these settings, click Yes. Click OK to return to Internet Explorer.

Impact of workaround. Microsoft .NET code will not run in Internet Explorer or will not run without prompting. Disabling Microsoft .NET applications and components in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.
Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone
After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.
To do this, perform the following steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Tools, click Internet Options, and then click the Security tab.
In the Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings box, click Trusted Sites, and then click Sites.
If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone check box.
In the Add this Web site to the zone box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click Add.
Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
Click OK two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

Note Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are *.windowsupdate.microsoft.com and *.update.microsoft.com. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
How to undo the workaround. Perform the following steps:

In Internet Explorer, click the Tools menu, and then select Internet Options.
Click the Security tab, click Reset all zones to default level, and then click OK.


Temporarily prevent the Microsoft Silverlight ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer (Method 1)
You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by temporarily preventing attempts to instantiate the Silverlight ActiveX control in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control.
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
We recommend that you back up the registry before you edit it.
Use the following text to create a .reg file that temporarily prevents attempts to instantiate the Silverlight ActiveX control in Internet Explorer. You can copy the following text, paste it into a text editor such as Notepad, and then save the file with the .reg file name extension. Run the .reg file on the vulnerable client.
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{DFEAF541-F3E1-4C24-ACAC-99C30715084A}]
"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

Close Internet Explorer and reopen it for the changes to take effect.
For detailed steps about stopping a control from running in Internet Explorer, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797. Follow these steps and create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent the Silverlight ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer.
Impact of workaround. Applications and Web sites that require the Microsoft Silverlight ActiveX control may no longer function correctly. If you implement this workaround it would affect any Silverlight ActiveX control you have installed on your system.
How to undo the workaround. Remove the registry keys added to temporarily prevent attempts to instantiate the Silverlight ActiveX control in Internet Explorer.

Temporarily prevent the Microsoft Silverlight ActiveX control from running in Firefox or Chrome
To modify the registry key to disable Microsoft Silverlight, follow these steps:
Note Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

Using the Interactive Method

Click Start, click Run, type Regedit in the Open box, and then click OK.
Locate and then click the following registry subkey:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MozillaPlugins\@Microsoft.com/NpCtrl,version=1.0
Right click on @Microsoft.com/NpCtrl,version=1.0 and select Export. Save the file to disk.
Delete the entire @Microsoft.com/NpCtrl,version=1.0 key.
Quit the registry editor.


Using a registry file

Create a backup copy of the registry keys. A backup copy can be made using a managed deployment script with the following command:
Regedit.exe /e SL_backup.reg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MozillaPlugins\@Microsoft.com/NpCtrl,version=1.0
Save the following to a file with a .REG extension (e.g. Disable_Silverlight.reg):
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MozillaPlugins\@Microsoft.com/NpCtrl,version=1.0]
Run the above registry script created in step 2 on the target system with the following command:
Regedit /s Disable_Silverlight.reg



How to undo the workaround.

Using the Interactive Method

Click Start, click Run, type Regedit in the Open box, and then click OK.
On the File menu, click Import.
In Look in, select the drive, folder, or network computer and folder where the file you previously exported is located.
Select the correct file name and then click Open.


Using a Managed Deployment Script
Restore the file backed up in Using a registry file Step 1, above, with the following command:
Regedit /s SL_backup.reg
