#### Workarounds for RTSP Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3225
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Disable Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service on affected systems**
  
    **Interactive Method**
  
    **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.  
    2.  Locate and then select the following registry key:  
        HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\WMPNetworkSvc  
    3.  Click the **File** menu and then click **Export**.  
    4.  In the **Export Registry File** dialog box, enter **WMPNetworkSvc\_Backup.reg** and then click **Save**.  
        **Note** This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default.  
    5.  Select the value **Start** on the right pane in the Registry Editor. Press **Enter** to edit the value of the key. Change the **Value** data field to **4**, and press **Enter**.  
    6.  From an elevated command prompt, stop the service by entering the following command:  
        `sc stop WMPNetworkSvc`
  
    **Managed Deployment Script**
  
    1.  Make a backup copy of the registry key using the following command:  
        `regedit /e WMPNetworkSvc_Backup.reg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\WMPNetworkSvc`  
    2.  Save the following to a file with a .REG extension (e.g., Disable\_WMPNetworkSvc.reg):  
        Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
        HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\service\_name\]  
        Start"=dword:00000004  
    3.  Run the registry script created in step 2 on the target machine with the following command:  
        `Regedit /s Disable_WMPNetworkSvc.reg`  
    4.  From an elevated command prompt, stop the service by entering the following command:  
        `sc stop WMPNetworkSvc`
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Windows Media Sharing will be disabled.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    Using the interactive method:
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.  
    2.  Click the **File** menu and then click **Import**.  
    3.  In the **Import Registry File** dialog box, select the **WMPNetworkSvc\_Backup.reg**file that was created in the "Interactive Method" above, and then click **Open**.  
    4.  Exit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.
  
    Using the managed deployment script:
  
    1.  Run the registry script created in step 2 on the target machine with the following command:  
        `Regedit /s WMPNetworkSvc_Backup.reg`  
    2.  Restart the computer.
