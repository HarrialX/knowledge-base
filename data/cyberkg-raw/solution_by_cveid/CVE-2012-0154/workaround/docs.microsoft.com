#### Workarounds for GDI Access Violation Vulnerability - CVE-2011-5046
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Read emails in plain text**
  
    To help protect yourself from the email attack vector, read email messages in plain text format.
  
    Microsoft Outlook 2003, Microsoft Outlook 2007, and Microsoft Outlook 2010 provide an option for reading email messages in plain text format. For more information about the **Read all standard mail in plain text** option, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 831607](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/831607).
  
    Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Office Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view email messages that are not digitally signed or email messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.
  
    Digitally signed email messages or encrypted email messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).
  
    For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Email messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:
  
    -   The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.  
    -   Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.  
    -   Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.
