#### Workarounds for SMB Response Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1268
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall**
  
    These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. For this specific vulnerability, both inbound and outbound SMB traffic should be blocked to reduce exposure. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:
  
    -   Applications that use SMB (CIFS)  
    -   Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)  
    -   Server (File and Print Sharing)  
    -   Group Policy  
    -   Net Logon  
    -   Distributed File System (DFS)  
    -   Terminal Server Licensing  
    -   Print Spooler  
    -   Computer Browser  
    -   Remote Procedure Call Locator  
    -   Fax Service  
    -   Indexing Service  
    -   Performance Logs and Alerts  
    -   Systems Management Server  
    -   License Logging Service
  
    **How to undo the workaround.** Unblock TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
