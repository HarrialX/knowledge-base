#### Workarounds for Print Spooler Service Impersonation Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2729
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Block ports associated with RPC at the firewall**
  
    -   UDP ports 135, 137, 138, and 445, and TCP ports 135, 139, 445, and 593  
    -   All unsolicited inbound traffic on ports greater than 1024  
    -   Any other specifically configured RPC port
  
    These ports are used to initiate a connection with RPC. Blocking them at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Also, make sure that you block any other specifically configured RPC port on the remote system. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:
  
    -   Applications that use SMB (CIFS)  
    -   Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)  
    -   Server (File and Print Sharing)  
    -   Group Policy  
    -   Net Logon  
    -   Distributed File System (DFS)  
    -   Terminal Server Licensing  
    -   Print Spooler  
    -   Computer Browser  
    -   Remote Procedure Call Locator  
    -   Fax Service  
    -   Indexing Service  
    -   Performance Logs and Alerts  
    -   Systems Management Server  
    -   License Logging Service
  
    **How to undo the workaround.** Unblock UDP ports 135, 137, 138, and 445, and TCP ports 135, 139, 445, and 593 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
  
-   **Disable printer sharing**
  
    To disable printer sharing, perform the following actions:
  
    On Windows XP and Windows 2003 systems
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Printer and Faxes**.  
    2.  Right-click the printer icon and select **Sharing**.  
    3.  Select **Do Not Share This Printer**, and then click **OK**.  
    4.  Repeat this process for each printer shared on the system.
  
    On all later Windows operating systems:
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Devices and Printers**.  
    2.  Right-click the printer icon and select **Printer properties**.  
    3.  Select the **Sharing** tab.  
    4.  Ensure the **Share this printer** option is not selected, and then click **OK**.  
    5.  Repeat this process for each printer shared on the system.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** By disabling this feature, remote users will not be able to print to the affected printer.
  
    **How to undo the workaround:**
  
    On Windows XP and Windows 2003 systems:
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Printer and Faxes**.  
    2.  Right-click the printer icon and select **Sharing**.  
    3.  Select **Share This Printer**, and then click **OK**.  
    4.  Repeat this process for each printer shared on the system.
  
    On all later Windows operating systems:
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Devices and Printers**.  
    2.  Right-click the printer icon and select **Printer properties**.  
    3.  Select the **Sharing** tab.  
    4.  Select the **Share this printer** option, and then click **OK**.  
    5.  Repeat this process for each printer shared on the system.
