#### Mitigating Factors for Print Spooler Service Impersonation Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2729
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   By default, printers are not shared on any of the currently supported Windows operating systems.  
-   Systems are only vulnerable to remote attack when sharing a printer and the remote attacker can access the printer share.  
-   Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
