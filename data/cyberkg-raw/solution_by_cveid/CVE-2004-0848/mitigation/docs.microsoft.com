Mitigating Factors for Buffer Overrun in Microsoft Office XP Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0848:

This vulnerability could only be exploited by an attacker who persuaded a user to open a malicious file hosted in Internet Explorer or click on a link in an email message.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.
Customers running Microsoft ISA 2004 as their web proxy have the ability to reject questionable URL's by utilizing an HTTP Filter Signature. For information on HTTP Filtering in ISA 2004, see the product documentation.
