Workarounds for Windows Print Spooler Components Vulnerability - CVE-2013-0011
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Disable the Print Spooler service
Disabling the Print Spooler service will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To disable the Print Spooler service, perform the following steps.
Interactive method:
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Click Start, click Run, type regedit, and then click OK.

In Registry Editor, expand the following registry location:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\

Select Print Spooler, and then click the File menu and select Export.

In the Export Registry File dialog, type spooler_configuration_backup.reg and click Save.

Double-click the registry DWORD entry named Start, change its value to 4, and then click OK.

Run the following command at a command prompt running as an administrator:
sc stop spooler


Using a managed deployment script:

Create a back-up copy of the registry keys using a managed deployment script with the following command:
regedit /e spooler_configuration_backup.reg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\spooler

Create a text file named Disable_spooler.reg with the following contents:
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Spooler]  
"Start"=dword:00000004


Run the registry script created in step 2 on the target system by using the following command:
Regedit /s Disable_spooler.reg

Run the following command at a command prompt running as an administrator:
sc stop spooler


Impact of workaround. Print-related components will not function properly; printing will be disabled.
How to undo the workaround. 
To undo the workaround if applied using the interactive method:

Click Start, click Run, type regedit, and then click OK.
Click the File menu and select Import.
In the Import Registry File dialog box select the registry backup file you created (spooler_configuration_backup.reg) and then click Open.

To undo the workaround if applied using the managed deployment script, run the following command at a command prompt running as an administrator:
Regedit /s spooler_configuration_backup.reg
