Mitigating Factors for RASMAN Registry Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2371:

The Remote Access Connection Manager service is not started by default for all supported Microsoft Windows operating systems with the exception of Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4. The only service dependent upon the Remote Access Connection Manager service is the Remote Access Auto Connection Manager. For Microsoft Windows 2000, the Internet Connection Sharing service depends on the Remote Access Connection Manager service. Enabling a dependent service could cause the Remote Access Connection Manager service to start.
On Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 systems, an attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely by anonymous users or by users who have standard user accounts. However, the affected component is available remotely to users who have administrative permissions
Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
