#### Workarounds for Media Services Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0478
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Stop and disable Windows Media Unicast Service**
  
    As an Administrator, disable the Windows Media Unicast Service by using the following command at the command prompt:  
    `sc stop nsunicast & sc config nsunicast start= disabled`
  
    **Impact of workaround.**Â Connections to the streaming media server via the Windows Media Unicast Service will not be allowed.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    As an Administrator, enable the Windows Media Unicast Service by using the following command at the command prompt:  
    `sc config nsunicast start= auto & sc start nsunicast`
  
-   **Uninstall the Windows Media Services component using Windows Component Wizard**
  
    1.  Log on to the computer as an administrator or a member of the Administrators group.  
    2.  Click **Start**, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**.  
    3.  In Control Panel, double-click **Add/Remove Programs**.  
    4.  Click **Add/Remove Windows Components**. The Windows Components Wizard starts and the Windows Components screen is displayed.  
    5.  Clear the **Windows Media Services** check box. Click **Next** and follow the instructions in the Windows Component Wizard.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** The server will no longer be configured as a streaming media server using Windows Media Services.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.** Install Windows Media Services via Windows Components Wizard.
