#### Mitigating Factors for Malformed Request Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3964
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   By default, the Document Conversions Load Balancer Service and Document Conversions Launcher Service are not enabled in Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute code as a guest account that only has rights to a specific temporary directory. The content of this specific temporary directory is cleaned up regularly.
