#### Workarounds for SSL and TLS Protocols Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3389
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Prioritize the RC4 Algorithm in server software on systems running Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, or Windows Server 2008 R2**
  
    The attack only affects cipher suites that use symmetric encryption algorithms in CBC mode, such as AES, and does not affect the RC4 algorithm. You can prioritize the RC4 algorithm in server software in order to facilitate secure communication using RC4 instead of CBC. Refer to this MSDN article, [Prioritizing Schannel Cipher Suites](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb870930%28v=vs.85%29.aspx), to learn how to perform this operation.
  
    **Warning** The client or server with which you are communicating must support the RC4 algorithm. If support for RC4 is not available, a different cipher suite will be used if one is available, and this workaround will be ineffective.
  
     
  
-   **Enable TLS 1.1 and/or 1.2 in client software on systems running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2**
  
    You can enable a different version of the TLS protocol that is not affected by this vulnerability. You can do this by modifying the Advanced Security settings of Internet Explorer.
          
    **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2643584](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2643584) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround for TLS 1.1.
  
    **Interactive Method**
  
    To change the default protocol version to be used for HTTPS requests, perform the following steps:
  
    1.  On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.  
    2.  In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Advanced** tab.  
    3.  In the **Security** category, select the **Use TLS 1.1** and/or **Use TLS 1.2** checkboxes.  
    4.  Click **OK**.  
    5.  Exit and restart Internet Explorer.
  
    **Warning** Web servers that don’t support TLS 1.1 or 1.2 will perform the SSL negotiation with lower SSL/TLS versions, voiding the workaround. 
  
    **Managed Deployment Method (Enable TLS 1.1 and disable SSLv2)**
  
    Save the following to a file with a .REG extension, such as Disable\_SSLv2.reg:
  
    ```
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
    ``` 
    ```
    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings]
    "SecureProtocols"=dword:00000200 
    ```
  
    You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, see the TechNet article, [Group Policy collection](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=215719).
  
    **Warning** Web servers that don’t support TLS 1.1 will perform the SSL negotiation with lower SSL/TLS versions, voiding the workaround.
  
     
  
-   **Enable TLS 1.1 in server software on systems running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2**
  
    You can enable TLS 1.1, which is not affected by the vulnerability.
  
    See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2643584](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2643584) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround for TLS 1.1.
  
    **Warning** Web clients that don’t support TLS 1.1 will perform the SSL negotiation with lower SSL/TLS versions, voiding the workaround.
  
    **Managed Deployment Method (Enable TLS 1.1)**
  
    Save the following to a file with a .REG extension, such as Enable\_TLSv11.reg:
  
    ```
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 
    ```
    ```
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.1\Client]"
    DisabledByDefault"=dword:00000000
    ```
    ```
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.1\Server]
    "DisabledByDefault"=dword:00000000
    ```
  
    You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, see the TechNet article, [Group Policy collection](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=215719).
  
    **Warning** Web clients that don’t support TLS 1.1 will perform the SSL negotiation with lower SSL/TLS versions, voiding the workaround.
