#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Saved Search Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1435
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open and save an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a malformed saved-search (.search-ms) file. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Attempts to exploit this vulnerability require user interaction.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.
