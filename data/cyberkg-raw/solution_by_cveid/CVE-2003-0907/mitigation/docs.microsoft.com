Mitigating Factors for LSASS Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0533:

Only Windows 2000 and Windows XP can be remotely attacked by an anonymous user. While Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 contain the vulnerability, only a local administrator could exploit it.
Windows NT 4.0 is not affected by this vulnerability.
Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

Mitigating Factors for LDAP Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0663:

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to send a specially crafted LDAP message to the domain controller. If the LDAP ports are not blocked by a firewall, an attacker would not require any additional privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
This vulnerability only affects Windows 2000 Server domain controllers; Windows Server 2003 domain controllers are not affected.
Windows NT 4.0 and Windows XP are not affected by this vulnerability.
If an attacker successfully exploited this vulnerability, the affected system might display a warning that it would automatically restart after a 60-second countdown. At the end of this 60-second countdown, the affected system would automatically restart. After restart, the affected system would be restored to normal functionality. However, the affected system could be susceptible to a new denial of service attack unless the update is applied.
Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks originating outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

Mitigating Factors for PCT Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0719:

Only systems that have enabled SSL are affected, typically only server systems. SSL support is not enabled by default on any of the affected systems. However, SSL is generally used on Web servers to support electronic commerce programs, online banking, and other programs that require secure communications.
Windows Server 2003 is only vulnerable to this issue if an administrator has manually enabled PCT (even if SSL has been enabled).
In some situations, the Web Publishing features of ISA Server 2000 or Proxy Server 2.0 can successfully block attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Testing has shown that the Web publishing features of ISA Server 2000, with Packet Filtering enabled and all Packet Filtering options selected can successfully block this attack with no noticeable side effects. Proxy Server 2.0 also successfully blocks this attack. However, until the security update is applied on the Proxy Server 2.0 system, this attack causes Proxy Server 2.0 Web services to stop responding and the system must be restarted.
Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

Mitigating Factors for Winlogon Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0806:

Only Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, and Windows XP systems that are members of a domain are affected by this vulnerability. Windows Server 2003 is not affected by this vulnerability.
An attacker would require permission to modify user objects in a domain to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. Typically, only members of the Administrators or Account Operators groups would have this permission. However, this permission may have been delegated to other user accounts in the domain.
Domains typically support auditing of changes to user objects. These audit records could be reviewed to determine which user account may have maliciously modified other user accounts to attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

Mitigating Factors for Metafile Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0906:

The vulnerability could only be exploited by an attacker who persuaded a user to open a specially crafted file or to view a directory that contains the specially crafted image. There is no way for an attacker to force a user to open a malicious file.
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.
Windows Server 2003 is not affected by this vulnerability.

Mitigating Factors for Help and Support Center Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0907:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.
The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all of the following conditions:

Apply the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-040 or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.
Use Internet Explorer 6 or later.
Use the Microsoft Outlook E-mail Security Update, use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or later, or use Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or later in its default configuration.


An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.

Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 are not affected by this vulnerability.


Mitigating Factors for Utility Manager Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0908:

An attacker must have valid logon credentials to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited by anonymous users.
Windows NT 4.0, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 are not affected by this vulnerability. Windows NT 4.0 does not implement the Utility Manager.
The Windows 2000 Hardening Guide recommends disabling the Utility Manger service. Environments that comply with these guidelines could be at a reduced risk from this vulnerability.

Mitigating Factors for Windows Management Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0909:
