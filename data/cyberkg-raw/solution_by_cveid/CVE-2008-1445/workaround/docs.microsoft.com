#### Workarounds for Active Directory Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1445
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Block TCP ports 389, 636, 3268 and 3269 at the perimeter firewall**
  
    These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking them at the enterprise firewall, both inbound and outbound, will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
  
V1.1 (June 11, 2008): Removed erroneous known issues entry from the Update FAQ. Also added ports to be blocked in the Workarounds for Active Directory Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1445 section.
