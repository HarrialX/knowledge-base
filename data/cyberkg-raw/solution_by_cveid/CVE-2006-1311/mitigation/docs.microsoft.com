Mitigating Factors for Microsoft RichEdit Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1311:

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
An attacker could only exploit this vulnerability when a user opens and then interacts with an embedded OLE object within a Rich Text Format (RTF) file or a Rich Text e-mail message.
This vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through a Web-based attack scenario. An attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an RTF file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince the user to open the file in a Microsoft Office application.
The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message and then interact with an embedded OLE object within a Rich Text Format (RTF) file, or interact with an embedded OLE object within a Rich Text e-mail message.
