#### Mitigating Factors for Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0237
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   ISA Server 2006 and Forefront TMG MBE deployments that do not have any Web publishing rules are not vulnerable by default. If ISA Server 2006 or Forefront TMG MBE is installed in a traditional firewall role and is not publishing any internal Web sites to the Internet, the vulnerable Web Filter will not be exposed (the port will be blocked).  
-   ISA Server 2006 or Forefront TMG MBE deployments that are used for Web publishing but are not using HTML forms authentication are not vulnerable.  
-   Even if Web publishing is enabled, the vulnerable code is exposed only if HTML forms authentication is enabled on the default Web listener.  
    **Note** Forefront TMG MBE as installed with Windows Essential Business Server is configured for forms-based authentication on the External Web Listener by default.
