#### Mitigating Factors for SMB Client Incomplete Response Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3676
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
