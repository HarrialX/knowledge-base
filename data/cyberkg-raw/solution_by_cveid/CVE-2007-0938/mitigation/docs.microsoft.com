Mitigating Factors for CMS Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0938:

On Microsoft Internet Information Service 6.0, the W3WP.exe worker process by default is a low-privilege process running as the built-in Network Service account.
Note – This only applies to Content Management Server 2002.

Customers who have configured Microsoft Content Management Server (MCMS) Web sites in their own application pools to isolate them from other Web sites could limit the impact of an attack.


Mitigating Factors for Cross-site Scripting and Spoofing Vulnerability in CMS Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0939:

The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must click a Web link that is sent in an e-mail message.
An attack would only be successful if the user that was convinced to click on the attacker’s specially crafted URL had access to the CMS Web server.
An attacker who successfully exploited the cross-site scripting aspect of this vulnerability would gain only the same permissions as the user.
Clients who have turned on the Do not save encrypted pages to disk advanced Internet option in Internet Explorer would not be at risk from any attempts to put spoofed content into the client cache if they accessed their Web site through the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
Clients who use SSL-protected connections to access the affected Web sites would not be vulnerable to attempts to put spoofed content on intermediate proxy server caches. This is because SSL session data is encrypted and is not cached on intermediate proxy servers.
If spoofed content is successfully put in an intermediate proxy server’s cache, it could be difficult for an attacker to predict which users would be served the spoofed cached content.
