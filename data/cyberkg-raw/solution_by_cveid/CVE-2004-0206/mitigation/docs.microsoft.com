Mitigating Factors for NetDDE Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0206:

Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
On Windows Server 2003 the NetDDE services are disabled by default. Typically only administrators can change the startup type of a service. An attacker would first have to change the startup type from Disabled, and then start the service to attempt to exploit this vulnerability.
Disabling the NetDDE services helps prevent the possibility of a remote attack. See the Workarounds section for instructions that describe how to disable these services. Operating systems other than Windows Server 2003 have the NetDDE services startup type set to Manual instead of Disabled by default.
Chapter 6 of the Microsoft Solution for Securing Windows 2000 Server,Hardening the Base Windows 2000 Server recommends disabling the NetDDE services. Environments that comply with these guidelines could be at a reduced risk from this vulnerability.
