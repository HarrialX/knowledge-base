Workarounds for MSXML Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1889
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Apply the Microsoft Fix it solution that blocks the attack vector for XML Core Services 5.0 
See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2722479 for instructions on applying an automated Microsoft Fix it solution that blocks the attack vector for XML Core Services 5.0. We recommend that administrators review the KB article closely prior to deploying this Fix it solution.

Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the Tools menu.
Click the Security tab.
Click Internet, and then click Custom Level.
Under Settings, in the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.
Click Local intranet, and then click Custom Level.
Under Settings, in the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.
Click OK two times to return to Internet Explorer.

Note Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.
Impact of workaround. There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click Yes to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".
Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone
After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and/or Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.
To do this, follow these steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Tools, click Internet Options, and then click the Security tab.
In the Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings box, click Trusted Sites, and then click Sites.
If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone check box.
In the Add this Web site to the zone box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click Add.
Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
Click OK two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

Note Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are "*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" and
"*.update.microsoft.com" (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

Prevent an ActiveX control from being run in Internet Explorer
You can disable attempts to instantiate the MSXML 5.0 for Microsoft Office ActiveX control in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the controls in the registry.
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797. Follow the steps in the article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.
To set the kill bit for the MSXML 5.0 for Microsoft Office ActiveX control, follow these steps:

Create a text file named Disable_MSXML5.reg with the following contents:
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{88d969e5-f192-11d4-a65f-0040963251e5}]
"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{88d969e5-f192-11d4-a65f-0040963251e5}]
"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{88d969e6-f192-11d4-a65f-0040963251e5}]
"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{88d969e6-f192-11d4-a65f-0040963251e5}]
"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

Double-click the .reg file to apply it to an individual system.

Restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.
Note You can also apply the registry change across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, see Group Policy collection.
