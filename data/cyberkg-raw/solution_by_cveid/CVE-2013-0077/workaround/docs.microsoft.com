Workarounds for Media Decompression Vulnerability - CVE-2013-0077
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Modify the Access Control List (ACL) on quartz.dll
To modify the ACL on quartz.dll to be more restrictive, follow these steps:
On Windows XP, run the following command from an elevated command prompt:
For 32-bit Windows systems:
Echo y| cacls %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\quartz.DLL /E /P everyone:N
For 64-bit Windows systems:
Echo y| cacls %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\quartz.DLL /E /P everyone:N Echo y| cacls %WINDIR%\SYSWOW64\quartz.DLL /E /P everyone:N
Impact of workaround: Windows Media Player will not be able to play .avi or .wav files.
How to undo the workaround:
On Windows XP, run the following command from an elevated command prompt:
For 32-bit Windows systems:
cacls %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\quartz.dll /E /R everyone
For 64-bit Windows systems:
cacls %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\quartz.dll /E /R everyone cacls %WINDIR%\SYSWOW64\quartz.dll /E /R everyone

Unregister quartz.dll
To unregister this DLL, run the following command from an elevated command prompt:
For 32-bit Windows systems:
Regsvr32.exe –u %WINDIR%\system32\quartz.dll
For 64-bit Windows systems:
Regsvr32.exe –u %WINDIR%\system32\quartz.dll Regsvr32.exe –u %WINDIR%\syswow64\quartz.dll
Impact of workaround: Windows Media Player will not be able to play .avi or .wav files.
How to undo the workaround: Run the following command from an elevated command prompt:
For 32-bit Windows systems:
Regsvr32.exe %WINDIR%\system32\quartz.dll
For 64-bit Windows systems:
Regsvr32.exe %WINDIR%\system32\quartz.dll Regsvr32.exe %WINDIR%\syswow64\quartz.dll
