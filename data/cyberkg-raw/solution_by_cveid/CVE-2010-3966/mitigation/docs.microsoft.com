#### Mitigating Factors for BranchCache Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3966
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   For an attack to be successful, a user must visit an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share and open a document from this location that is then loaded by a vulnerable application.  
-   The file sharing protocol Server Message Block (SMB) is often disabled on the perimeter firewall. This limits the possible attack vectors for this vulnerability.
