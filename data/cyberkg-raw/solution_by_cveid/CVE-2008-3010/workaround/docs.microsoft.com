Workarounds for ISATAP Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3010
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Block IP Protocol Type 41 (ISATAP) at the firewall
The ISATAP protocol is defined as protocol type 41 by RFC4214: Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP). Blocking this protocol type at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports or protocols.
