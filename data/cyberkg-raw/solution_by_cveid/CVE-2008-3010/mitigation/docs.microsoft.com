Mitigating Factors for SPN Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3009
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

Windows Media Services is an optional component on all Windows Server platforms and is not installed by default.
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
For Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 x64-based Systems, Windows Media Format Runtime 11 is only present on the system when Desktop Experience is installed.
