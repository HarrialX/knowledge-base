Mitigating Factors for Telephony Service Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0058:

Remote code execution is possible if you have manually enabled the telephony server feature. The telephony server feature is only available on Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server 2003. For information about this feature, visit the following Web site.
On Windows Server 2003 the Telephony service is restricted to authenticated user accounts, even when enabled as a telephony server. Anonymous attacks are not possible on Windows Server 2003.
On Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server 2003 based systems that have not manually configured the telephony server feature, this is a local elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.
On Windows 2000 Professional and on Windows XP, this is a local elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.
By default, the Telephony service is not running on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. However, the TAPI client will start the Telephony service without user interaction when required. Unless the Telephony service has been set to Disabled by an administrator, a non-privileged user account can start this service. Systems that have disabled the Telephony service would not be vulnerable to this issue.
Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
