#### Workarounds for Win32k Null Pointer De-reference Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1985
  
Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.
  
#### Workarounds for Win32k TrueType Font Type Translation Vulnerability - CVE-2011-2002
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Disable the** **WebClient** **service**
  
    Disabling the WebClient service helps protect affected systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability by blocking the most likely remote attack vector through the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service. After applying this workaround it is still possible for remote attackers who successfully exploit this vulnerability to cause the system to run programs located on the targeted user's computer or the Local Area Network (LAN), but users will be prompted for confirmation before opening arbitrary programs from the Internet.
  
    To disable the WebClient Service, perform the following steps:
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.  
    2.  Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.  
    3.  Change the Startup type to **Disabled**. If the service is running, click **Stop**.  
    4.  Click **OK** and exit the management application.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** When the WebClient service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. In addition, any services that explicitly depend on the WebClient service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. For example, WebDAV shares will be inaccessible from the client computer.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    To re-enable the WebClient Service, perform the following steps:
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.  
    2.  Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.  
    3.  Change the Startup type to **Automatic**. If the service is not running, click **Start**.  
    4.  Click **OK** and exit the management application.
