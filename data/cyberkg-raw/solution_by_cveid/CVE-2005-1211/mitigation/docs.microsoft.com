Mitigating Factors for PNG Image Rendering Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1211:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could also try to compromise a Web site and have it display malicious content. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or to a site that has been compromised by the attacker.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

Mitigating Factors for XML Redirect Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CAN-2002-0648:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could also try to compromise a Web site and have it display malicious content. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or to a site that has been compromised by the attacker.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain access to XML on a system other than that of the attackerâ€™s Web site.
By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 2000 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been applied. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018 has been applied. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability.
The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message or click a link in an e-mail message.
By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section of this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:

Apply the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-040 or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.
Use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or a later version in its default configuration.
Use Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or a later version in its default configuration.
