Mitigating Factors for PNG Processing Vulnerability in Windows Media Player- CAN-2004-1244:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability through media containing a reference to a malicious PNG file. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or to a site that has been compromised by the attacker.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

Mitigating Factors for PNG Processing Vulnerability in Windows Messenger - CAN-2004-0597:

The nature of the vulnerability is different in Windows Messenger than in MSN Messenger or Windows Media Player. The vulnerability in Windows Messenger would be very complex to exploit and requires a large amount of effort and knowledge about the internal network of an organization to attempt to exploit this vulnerability.
A user would have to be running Windows Messenger and have it configured to receive .NET Alerts.

Mitigating Factors for PNG Processing Vulnerability in MSN Messenger - CAN-2004-0597:

Starting February 10, 2005, the MSN Messenger service will notify customers running a vulnerable version of MSN Messenger that there is an upgrade available. Customers that have accepted this upgrade and have applied the update will be protected from this vulnerability. Customers that have not accepted this upgrade may not be allowed to connect to the MSN Messenger service.
MSN Messenger, by default, does not allow anonymous people to send you messages. An attacker would first need to entice you to add them to your contacts list.
