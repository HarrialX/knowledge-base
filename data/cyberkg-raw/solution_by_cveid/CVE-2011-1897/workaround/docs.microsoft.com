#### Workarounds for Poisoned Cup of Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1969
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Blacklist the MicrosoftClient.Jar file**
  
    Add the entry for the following file:
  
    Java\\jre6\\lib\\security\\blacklist
  
    ```
    # UAG Client MicrosoftClient.jar
    SHA1-Digest-Manifest: dBKbNW1PZSjJ0lGcCeewcCrYx5g=
    ```
**Impact of workaround.** MicrosoftClient.JAR will be blocked from running on the system.

**How to undo the workaround.** 

Remove the entry for the following file:

Java\\jre6\\lib\\security\\blacklist

```
# UAG Client MicrosoftClient.jar
SHA1-Digest-Manifest: dBKbNW1PZSjJ0lGcCeewcCrYx5g=
```
