Mitigating Factors for Outlook URI Vulnerability – CVE-2008-0110
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site and convince a user to click on a specially crafted mailto URI in order to exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an e-mail message that contains a specially crafted mailto URI and click on the mailto link.
This vulnerability is not exploitable by simply viewing an e-mail through the Outlook preview pane.
