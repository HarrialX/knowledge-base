Workarounds for Office Component Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0107
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Disable loading of libraries from WebDAV and remote network shares
Note See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107 to deploy a workaround tool that allows customers to disable the loading of libraries from remote network or WebDAV shares. This tool can be configured to disallow insecure loading on a per-application or a global system basis.
Customers who are informed by their vendor of an application being vulnerable can use this tool to help protect against attempts to exploit this issue.
Note See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107 to use the automated Microsoft Fix it solution to deploy the registry key to block loading of libraries for SMB and WebDAV shares. Note that this Fix it solution does require you to install the workaround tool also described in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107 first. This Fix it solution only deploys the registry key and requires the workaround tool in order to be effective. We recommend that administrators review the KB article closely prior to deploying this Fix it solution.

Disable the WebClient service
Disabling the WebClient service helps protect affected systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability by blocking the most likely remote attack vector through the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service. After applying this workaround it is still possible for remote attackers who successfully exploit this vulnerability to cause the system to run programs located on the targeted user's computer or the Local Area Network (LAN), but users will be prompted for confirmation before opening arbitrary programs from the Internet.
To disable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

Click Start, click Run, type Services.msc and then click OK.
Right-click WebClient service and select Properties.
Change the Startup type to Disabled. If the service is running, click Stop.
Click OK and exit the management application.

Impact of workaround. When the WebClient service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. In addition, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. For example, WebDAV shares will be inaccessible from the client computer.
How to undo the workaround.
To re-enable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

Click Start, click Run, type Services.msc and then click OK.
Right-click WebClient service and select Properties.
Change the Startup type to Automatic. If the service is not running, click Start.
Click OK and exit the management application.


Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall
These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, TCP and UDP Port Assignments.
Impact of workaround. Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:

Applications that use SMB (CIFS)
Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
Server (File and Print Sharing)
Group Policy
Net Logon
Distributed File System (DFS)
Terminal Server Licensing
Print Spooler
Computer Browser
Remote Procedure Call Locator
Fax Service
Indexing Service
Performance Logs and Alerts
Systems Management Server
License Logging Service

How to undo the workaround. Unblock TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see TCP and UDP Port Assignments.


Workarounds for Microsoft Office Graphic Object Dereferencing Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0977
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality.

Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents in Microsoft Excel from unknown or untrusted sources and locations
The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.
Note Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.
For Office 2003 
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]
"BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001
Note In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2003, all of the latest security updates for Microsoft Office 2003 must be applied.
For Office 2007
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]
"BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001
Note In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2007, all of the latest security updates for Office 2007 must be applied.
Impact of workaround. For Microsoft Office 2003 and Microsoft Office 2007, users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special exempt directory or have not moved files to a trusted location as discussed in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848 will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions.
How to undo the workaround.
For Office 2003
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]
"BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000
For Office 2007
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]
"BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000

Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources
The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) helps protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.
To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or Office 2007 installed.
To install MOICE, you must also have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the Microsoft Download Center.
MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit Microsoft Update to install all recommended updates.
Enable MOICE
Note See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865 to use the automated Microsoft Fix it solution to enable or disable this workaround.
