#### Workarounds for Permissions on New Cluster Disks Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3223
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   After creating a cluster disk administrative share, manually configure its Access Control List (ACL) to reflect the access permissions appropriate for the environment. For Example, change the permissions on administrative shares from Everyone - Full Control to Administrators - Full Control.  
-   Server administrators can also choose to re-cluster the affected disks after the update is applied. This will properly set the permissions on the new shared cluster disks.
