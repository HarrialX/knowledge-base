#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Media Player Sampling Rate Vulnerability - CVE-2008-2253
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
-   V1.1 (September 10, 2008): Removed erroneous entry from **Mitigating Factors for Windows Media Player Sampling Rate Vulnerability - CVE-2008-2253**.  
-   V2.0 (September 15, 2008): Added entry to the **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update** section to communicate the re-release of the Norwegian language update for Windows Media Player 11 on all supported 32-bit editions of Windows XP. Customers who require the Norwegian language update need to download and install the re-released update. Also removed an erroneous entry from the Non-Affected software table.
