#### Workarounds for Windows Media Player Sampling Rate Vulnerability - CVE-2008-2253
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Unregister wmpeffects.dll**  
    To unregister this DLL, run the following command from an elevated command prompt:  
    -   **For 32-bit Windows-based systems:**  
        Regsvr32.exe –u %WINDIR%\\system32\\wmpeffects.dll  
    -   **For 64-bit Windows-based systems:**  
        Regsvr32.exe –u %WINDIR%\\syswow64\\wmpeffects.dll  
    -   **Impact of workaround:** Visualizations will fail to display in the Now Playing view of Windows Media Player.  
    -   **How to undo the workaround:** Run the following command from an elevated command prompt:  
        -   **For 32-bit Windows-based systems:**  
            Regsvr32.exe %WINDIR%\\system32\\wmpeffects.dll  
        -   **For 64-bit Windows-based systems:**  
            Regsvr32.exe %WINDIR%\\syswow64\\wmpeffects.dll
