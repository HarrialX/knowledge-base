Mitigating Factors for Windows Address Book Contact Record Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2386:

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. In order for the exploit to take place, the user would have to open the .wab file.
In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted .wab file to the user and by persuading the user to open the file.
