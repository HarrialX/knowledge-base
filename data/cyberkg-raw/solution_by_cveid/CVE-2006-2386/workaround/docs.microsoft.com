Workarounds for Windows Address Book Contact Record Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2386:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section:

Back up and remove the .wab file association
Removing the WAB registry key helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To backup and remove the WAB registry key, follow these steps:
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.

Click Start, click Run, type “regedit" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.
Expand HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, and then click .WAB.
Click File, and then click Export.
In the Export Registry File dialog box, type a file name in the File Name box, and then click Save.
Click Edit, and then click Delete to remove the registry key.
In the Confirm Key Delete dialog box, you receive an “Are you sure you want to delete this key and all of its subkeys” message. Click Yes.



Impact of Workaround: Users will not be able to open address books by double clicking them. They will have to manually start the Windows Address Book application and pass the address book to be used as a command line parameter or they can import the address book from the File menu. This does not affect the use of address books in Outlook Express.
