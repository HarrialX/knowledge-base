Workarounds for Active Directory Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3406
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Block TCP port 389 at your enterprise firewall
This port is used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking it at the enterprise firewall, both inbound and outbound, will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see TechNet article, TCP and UDP Port Assignments. For more information about the Windows Firewall, see TechNet article, How to Configure Windows Firewall on a Single Computer.
