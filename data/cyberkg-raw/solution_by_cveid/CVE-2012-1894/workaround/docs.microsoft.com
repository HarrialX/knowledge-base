#### Workarounds for Office for Mac Improper Folder Permissions Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1894
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Remove write permission from others in affected folders**
  
    To manually change the permissions, run each of the following commands in /Applications/Utilities/Terminal:
  
    `/usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod -R -P o-w /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/SharePointWebKitPlugin.webplugin/`  
    `/usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod -R -P o-w /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/SharePointBrowserPlugin.plugin/`  
    `/usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod -R -P o-w /Library/Fonts/Microsoft/`  
    `/usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod -R -P o-w /Library/Automator/`
