  "text" : "A DLL Hijack issue was discovered in Rockwell Automation Connected Components Workbench (CCW). The following versions are affected: Connected Components Workbench - Developer Edition, v9.01.00 and earlier: 9328-CCWDEVENE, 9328-CCWDEVZHE, 9328-CCWDEVFRE, 9328-CCWDEVITE, 9328-CCWDEVDEE, 9328-CCWDEVESE, and 9328-CCWDEVPTE; and Connected Components Workbench - Free Standard Edition (All Supported Languages), v9.01.00 and earlier. Certain DLLs included with versions of CCW software can be potentially hijacked to allow an attacker to gain rights to a victim's affected personal computer. Such access rights can be at the same or potentially higher level of privileges as the compromised user account, including and up to computer administrator privileges.\n" ,
