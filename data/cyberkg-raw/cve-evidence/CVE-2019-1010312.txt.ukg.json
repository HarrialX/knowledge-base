  "text" : "Tildeslash Monit Version 5.25.2 and earlier is affected by: Buffer Over-read. The impact is: Disclosure of memory contents in an HTTP response, and Denial of Service. The component is: In function Util_urlDecode() on lines 1553 -1563 in Monit/src/util.c, a crafted POST parameter can cause the buffer index to increment to a value greater than the length of the buffer. The attack vector is: An authenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a HTTP POST request that contains a maliciously crafted body parameter. The fixed version is: Version 5.25.3 and later.\n" ,
