The vulnerability is due to insufficient permission restrictions on a specific process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to an affected device with remote support credentials and initiating the specific process on the device and sending crafted data to that process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write files to the underlying file system with root privileges.\n" ,
