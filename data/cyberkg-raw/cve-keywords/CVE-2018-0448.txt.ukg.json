  "text" : "A vulnerability in the identity management service of Cisco Digital Network Architecture (DNA) Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and take complete control of identity management functions. The vulnerability is due to insufficient security restrictions for critical management functions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a valid identity management request to the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to view and make unauthorized modifications to existing system users as well as create new users.\n" ,
