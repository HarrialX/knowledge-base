  "text" : "An issue was discovered in LibTIFF 4.0.9. In TIFFFindField in tif_dirinfo.c, the structure tif is being dereferenced without first checking that the structure is not empty and has the requested fields (tif_foundfield). In the call sequences following from the affected library functions (TIFFVGetField, TIFFVGetFieldDefaulted, TIFFVStripSize, TIFFScanlineSize, TIFFTileSize, TIFFGetFieldDefaulted, and TIFFGetField), this sanitization of the tif structure is never being done and, hence, using them with an invalid or empty tif structure will trigger a buffer overflow, leading to a crash.\n" ,
