The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by invoking an interface monitoring mechanism with a crafted argument on the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary, system-level commands with root privileges on an affected device.\n" ,
