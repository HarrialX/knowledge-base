  "text" : "On Arris Touchstone Telephony Gateway TG1682G 9.1.103J6 devices, a logout action does not immediately destroy all state on the device related to the validity of the \"credential\" cookie, which might make it easier for attackers to obtain access at a later time (e.g., \"at least for a few minutes\"). NOTE: there is no documentation stating that the web UI's logout feature was supposed to do anything beyond removing the cookie from one instance of a web browser; a client-side logout action is often not intended to address cases where a person has made a copy of a cookie outside of a browser.\n" ,
