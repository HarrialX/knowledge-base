To update your system, please follow these instructions: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades.
After a standard system upgrade, additional dovecot configuration changes
are needed.
ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable configuration update, the dovecot
settings in /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf need to be updated manually.
During the update, a configuration file conflict will be shown.
The default setting “mail_extra_groups = mail” should be changed to
“mail_privileged_group = mail”.  If your local configuration uses groups
other than “mail”, you may need to use the new “mail_access_groups”
setting as well.
