Update instructions
The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:
Ubuntu 17.10


memcached
              
              -
              
                1.4.33-1ubuntu3.2






Ubuntu 16.04


memcached
              
              -
              
                1.4.25-2ubuntu1.3






Ubuntu 14.04


memcached
              
              -
              
                1.4.14-0ubuntu9.2






In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
Please note that after applying this update, Memcached will no longer
listen to UDP by default. If UDP service is desired, please add
'-U 11211' to /etc/memcached.conf and restart the memcached service.
