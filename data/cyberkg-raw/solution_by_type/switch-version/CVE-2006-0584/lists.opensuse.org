This issue was reportedly addressed in PeopleTools versions 8.47 and later.

The vendor has reported that Enterprise PeopleTools 8.47 and subsequent versions provide Triple DES encryption and an enhanced version of the PSCipher utility including a command-like tool that encrypts a variety of text values stored in various configuration files.  The product also provides dynamic key generation to generate unique encryption keys and a key file that maintains a version history of all previous versions of the keys, thus enabling text previously encrypted to be encrypted or decrypted.

The vendor also advises customers to refrain from using PSCipher as a general-purpose routine to protect other types of data.
