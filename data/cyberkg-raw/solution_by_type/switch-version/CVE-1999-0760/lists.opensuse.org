From the Allaire advisory:

Allaire has released a patch that allows administrators of servers hosting multiple applications to disable the undocumented tags and functions using registry settings. To perform server administrative functions, administrators can temporarily re-enable the administrative tags and functions, and disable them again when administrative tasks are complete.
