Update instructions
The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
mozilla-thunderbird - 1.5.0.4-0ubuntu6.06
mozilla-thunderbird-enigmail - 2:0.94-0ubuntu4.1

To update your system, please follow these instructions: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades.
After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Thunderbird to
effect the necessary changes.
Please note that Thunderbird 1.0.8 in Ubuntu 5.10 and Ubuntu 5.04 are
also affected by these problems. Updates for these Ubuntu releases
will be delayed due to upstream dropping support for this Thunderbird
version. We strongly advise that you disable JavaScript to disable the
attack vectors for most vulnerabilities if you use one of these Ubuntu
versions.
