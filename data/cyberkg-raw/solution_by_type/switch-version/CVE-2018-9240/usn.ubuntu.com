Update instructions
The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:
Ubuntu 16.04


ncmpc
              
              -
              
                0.24-1+deb8u1build0.16.04.1






ncmpc-lyrics
              
              -
              
                0.24-1+deb8u1build0.16.04.1






After a standard system update you need to restart ncmpc to make all the
necessary changes.
