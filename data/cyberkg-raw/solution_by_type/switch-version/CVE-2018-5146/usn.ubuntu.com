Update instructions
The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:
Ubuntu 17.10


libvorbis0a
              
              -
              
                1.3.5-4ubuntu0.2






Ubuntu 16.04


libvorbis0a
              
              -
              
                1.3.5-3ubuntu0.2






Ubuntu 14.04


libvorbis0a
              
              -
              
                1.3.2-1.3ubuntu1.2






After a standard system upgrade you need to restart any applications that
use libvorbis, such as Totem and gtkpod, to effect the necessary changes.
