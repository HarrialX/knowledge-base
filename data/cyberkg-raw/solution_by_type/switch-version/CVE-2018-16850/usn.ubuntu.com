Update instructions
The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:
Ubuntu 18.10


postgresql-10
              
              -
              
                10.6-0ubuntu0.18.10.1






Ubuntu 18.04


postgresql-10
              
              -
              
                10.6-0ubuntu0.18.04.1






This update uses a new upstream release, which includes additional bug
fixes. After a standard system update you need to restart PostgreSQL to
make all the necessary changes.
