Update instructions
The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:
Ubuntu 12.04


libnss3
              
              -
              
                2:3.28.4-0ubuntu0.12.04.2






After a standard system update you need to restart any applications that
use NSS, such as Evolution, to make all the necessary changes.
