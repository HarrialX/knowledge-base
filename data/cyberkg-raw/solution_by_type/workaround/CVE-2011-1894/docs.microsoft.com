Workarounds for MHTML Mime-Formatted Request Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1894
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Disable the MHTML protocol handler
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
Interactive method:
To manually disable the MHTML protocol handler, follow these steps:

Open Registry Editor.
Navigate to the following registry key:
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\PROTOCOLS\Handler\mhtml
Back up the mhtml registry key by right-clicking it, selecting Export, and saving it as a registry file (i.e., "mhtml pluggable protocol registry backup.reg").
Delete the mhtml key from the registry by right-clicking it and selecting Delete.

Using a managed deployment script:
To disable the MHTML protocol handler using a managed deployment script, follow these steps:

Back up the mhtml registry key using the following command line entry:
regedit /e mhtml_pluggable_protocol_registry_backup.reg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\PROTOCOLS\Handler\mhtml
Create the managed deployment script by saving the following to a file with a .reg extension (i.e., disable_mhtml_pluggable_protocol.reg):
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\PROTOCOLS\Handler\mhtml]
Run the managed deployment script on a target system using the following command line entry:
regedit.exe /s disable_mhtml_pluggable_protocol.reg

Impact of workaround. The MHTML protocol will cease to function. Any application that uses MHTML will be affected by this workaround.
How to undo the workaround. To undo this workaround, double-click the backup registry file created using the above procedures.
