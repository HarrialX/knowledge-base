Workarounds for HTML Help Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1208:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Unregister HTML Help InfoTech Protocol
To help reduce the likelihood of a remote attack you can unregister the HTML Help InfoTech protocol. Follow these steps to unregister this protocol:

Click Start, click Run, type "regsvr32 /u %windir%\system32\itss.dll" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.
Note On Windows 98 and Windows Millennium Edition, replace "system32" with "system" in this command.

A dialog box appears and confirms that the unregistration process has succeeded. Click OK to close the dialog box.
Impact of Workaround: All HTML Help functionality will be unavailable. This will affect the online Help in Windows or in any application that uses HTML Help functionality.
