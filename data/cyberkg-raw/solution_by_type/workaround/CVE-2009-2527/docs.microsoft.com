#### Workarounds for WMP Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2527
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Modify the Access Control List (ACL) on strmdll.dll**
  
    To modify the ACL on strmdll.dll to be more restrictive on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, run the following commands from a command prompt with administrative privileges:
  
    For 32-bit Windows Systems:
  
    `Echo y| cacls %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\strmdll.DLL /E /P everyone:N`
  
    For x64-based Windows Systems:
  
    `Echo y| cacls %WINDIR%\SYSWOW64\strmdll.DLL /E /P everyone:N`
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Windows Media Player 6.4 will not be able to play media files.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, run the following commands from a command prompt with administrative privileges:
  
    For 32-bit Windows Systems:
  
    `cacls %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\strmdll.dll /E /R everyone`
  
    For x64-based Windows Systems:
  
    `cacls %WINDIR%\SYSWOW64\strmdll.dll /E /R everyone`
  
-   **For non-multimedia folder types, the Windows shell attack vector can be mitigated by using Windows Classic Folders**
  
    To change folder options, perform the following steps:
  
    1. Click **Start**, click **Control Panel**, click **Appearance and Themes**, and then click **Folder Options**. Or, open any folder, such as **My Documents**, and on the **Tools** menu, click **Folder Options**.
  
    2. On the **General** tab, under **Tasks**, select **Use Windows classic folders**.
