Workarounds for Microsoft Office Execution Jump Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0103
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Restrict access to VBE6.dll
To restrict access to VBE6.dll, type the following at the command prompt:
For Windows XP:
Echo y|cacls "%ProgramFiles%\common files\microsoft shared\vba\vba6\vbe6.dll" /E /P everyone:N

For Windows Vista:
Takeown.exe /f "%ProgramFiles%\common files\microsoft shared\vba\vba6\vbe6.dll"
Icacls.exe "%ProgramFiles%\common files\microsoft shared\vba\vba6\vbe6.dll" /save %TEMP%\VBE6_ACL.TXT
Icacls.exe "%ProgramFiles%\common files\microsoft shared\vba\vba6\vbe6.dll" /deny everyone:(F)

Impact of workaround: The impact of implementing this workaround is that Microsoft Office files with VBA content (such as with macros) will no longer load.
How to undo the workaround: To rollback this workaround, type the following at the command prompt:
For Windows XP:
cacls "%ProgramFiles%\common files\microsoft shared\vba\vba6\vbe6.dll" /E /R everyone

For Windows Vista:
icacls "%ProgramFiles%\common files\microsoft shared\vba\vba6\vbe6.dll" /grant everyone:(F)
icacls "%ProgramFiles%\common files\microsoft shared\vba\vba6" /restore %TEMP%\VBE6_ACL.TXT


Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.
