Workarounds for Windows Briefcase Integer Underflow Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1527
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Uninstall the Briefcase namespace shell extension
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Create a backup copy of the registry keys by performing the following command from an elevated command prompt:
Regedit.exe /e briefcase_workaround_rollback.reg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{85BBD920-42A0-1069-A2E4-08002B30309D}

Create a text file named Disable_briefcase.reg with the following contents:
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{85BBD920-42A0-1069-A2E4-08002B30309D}]

Run Disable_briefcase.reg with the following command from an elevated command prompt:
Regedit.exe /s Disable_briefcase.reg


Impact of workaround. If you uninstall the Briefcase namespace shell extension, then the Briefcase sync mechanism will no longer be available.
