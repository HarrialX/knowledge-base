Workarounds for DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control Cross Domain Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1319:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to prompt before running ActiveX controls and active scripting in these zones.
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and active scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.
To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click Internet Options.
In the Internet Options dialog box, click the Security tab, and then click the Internet icon.
Under Security level for this zone, move the slider to High. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

Note If no slider is visible, click Default Level, and then move the slider to High.
Note Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the high security setting.
Alternatively, you can change you settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls only. To do this, follow these steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the Tools menu.
Click the Security tab.
Click Internet, and then click Custom Level.
Under Settings, in the ActiveX controls and plug-ins section, under Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins, click Prompt.
In the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click Prompt, and then click OK.
Click Local intranet, and then click Custom Level.
Under Settings, in the ActiveX controls and plug-ins section, under Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins, click Prompt.
In the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click Prompt.
Click OK two times to return to Internet Explorer.

Impact of Workaround: There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click Yes to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the "Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites" workaround.

Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites.
After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and active scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.
To do this, follow these steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Tools, click Internet Options, and then click the Security tab.
In the Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings box, click Trusted Sites, and then click Sites.
If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone check box.
In the Add this Web site to the zone box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click Add.
Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
Click OK two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. One in particular that you may want to add is "*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" (without the quotation marks). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX control to install the update.

Install the update that is described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018 if you are using Outlook Express 5.5 SP2.
Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018 has been installed.
Customers running Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 who have installed Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018 could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability unless the user clicks a malicious link in the e-mail message.

Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 a later version, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or a later version , to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.
Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed, or view e-mail messages that are not encrypted, in plain text only.
Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about enabling this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594.
For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387.
Impact of Workaround: E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.


Temporarily disable the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control from running in Internet Explorer for Windows XP Service Pack 2.
You can help protect against this vulnerability by temporarily disabling the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control from running in Internet Explorer. On Windows XP Service Pack 2 use the Internet Explorer Manage Add-ons feature to disable the ActiveX control.

Start Internet Explorer.
On the Tools menu, click Manage Add-ons.
Locate and click on "DHTML Edit Control Safe for Scripting for IE5".
To disable the add-on, click Disable, and then click OK.

Note If you cannot locate the ActiveX control then use the drop-down box to switch from "Add-ons currently being used in Internet Explorer" to "Add-ons that have been used by Internet Explorer" and follow steps 3 and 4. If the ActiveX control is not present in this list either you have not used the ActiveX control before. See the workaround "Temporarily disable the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control from running in Internet Explorer" for additional information.
Note If you use this workaround, you must re-enable this ActiveX control. You should do this after you have applied this security update to regain the functionality that is supplied by the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control.
For more information on the Internet Explorer Manage Add-ons feature in Windows XP Service Pack 2, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 883256.
Impact of Workaround: Disabling the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX control prevents Internet Explorer from instantiating the control. This configuration causes program compatibility issues. Some examples of such issues include the following:

You cannot compose e-mail messages in Outlook Web Access for Exchange 2000 Server and Exchange Server 2003.
You cannot use Windows SharePoint Services for Windows Server 2003. This product uses the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX control for dynamic Web site HTML editing.
Other Web sites may rely on this ActiveX control for dynamic Web site HTML editing.


Temporarily disable the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control from running in Internet Explorer.
You can help protect against this vulnerability by temporarily disabling the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control from running in Internet Explorer. To do this, set the kill bit for the control.
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require that you reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
The class identifier (CLSID) for an ActiveX control is a GUID for that control. You can prevent an ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit so that the control is never called by Internet Explorer. The kill bit is a specific value for the Compatibility Flags DWORD value for the ActiveX control in the registry.
The CLSID for the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control is {2D360201-FFF5-11D1-8D03-00A0C959BC0A}.
For detailed steps that describe how to stop an ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797. Follow the steps in that article and create a Compatibility Flags DWORD value in the registry to prevent the affected control from being instantiated in Internet Explorer
Note If you use this workaround, you must reset this registry change by removing the same Compatibility Flags DWORD value from the registry. You should do this after you have applied this security update to regain the functionality that is supplied by the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control.
Impact of Workaround: Disabling the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX control prevents Internet Explorer from instantiating the control. This configuration causes program compatibility issues. Some examples of such issues include the following:

You cannot compose e-mail messages in Outlook Web Access for Exchange 2000 Server and Exchange Server 2003.
You cannot use Windows SharePoint Services for Windows Server 2003. This product uses the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX control for dynamic Web site HTML editing.
Other Web sites may rely on this ActiveX control for dynamic Web site HTML editing.
