#### Workarounds for Wireless Frame Parsing Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1132
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Unregister Wlansvc**
  
    To modify the registry key, perform the following steps:
  
    **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
  
    **Using the Interactive Method**
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.  
    2.  Locate and then click the following registry subkey:  
        HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services  
    3.  Click **Wlansvc**.  
    4.  Click the **File** menu and select **Export**.  
    5.  In the **Export Registry File** dialog box, enter **Wlansvc\_configuration\_backup.reg** and click **Save**.    
		**Note** This will create a backup of this registry key in the **My Documents** folder by default.  
    6.  Double-click the **Start** value and change the **Value** data field to **4**.  
    7.  Click **OK**.  
    8.  Run the following command from a command prompt as an administrator:
  
    `sc stop Wlansvc`
  
    **Using a Managed Deployment Script**
  
    1.  Create a backup copy of the registry keys by using a managed deployment script that contains the following commands:  
        Regedit.exe /e Wlansvc\_configuration\_backup.reg  
        HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Wlansvc  
    2.  Next, save the following to a file with a .REG extension, such as Disable\_Wlansvc.reg:  
        Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
        \[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Wlansvc\]  
        "Start"=dword:00000004  
    3.  Run the above registry script on the target machine with the following command:  
        Regedit.exe /s Disable\_Wlansvc.reg  
    4.  Run the following command from a command prompt as an administrator:  
        sc stop Wlansvc
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Wireless networking will not be available.
  
    **How to undo the workaround:**
  
    **Using the Interactive Method**
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.  
    2.  Click the **File** menu and select **Import**.  
    3.  In the Import Registry File dialog box, select **Wlansvc\_configuration\_backup.reg** and click **Open**.
  
    **Using a Managed Deployment Script**
  
    Restore the original state by running the following command:  
    Regedit.exe /s Wlansvc\_configuration\_backup.reg
