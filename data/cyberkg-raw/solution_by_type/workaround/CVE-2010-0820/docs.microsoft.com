Workarounds for LSASS Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0820
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Block TCP port 389 at the firewall
Block TCP port 389 at the firewall. This port is used to initiate a connection with the affected component.
Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see TCP and UDP Port Assignments. For more information about the Windows Firewall, see How to Configure Windows Firewall on a Single Computer.
