#### Workarounds for Graphics Rendering Engine Vulnerability - CVE-2005-4560:
  
Microsoft has tested the following workaround. While this workaround will not correct the underlying vulnerability, it will help block known attack vectors.
  
-   **Unregister the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer (Shimgvw.dll) on Windows XP Service Pack 1; Windows XP Service Pack 2; Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1**
  
    Microsoft has tested the following workaround. While this workaround will not correct the underlying vulnerability, it helps block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.
  
    **Note** This workaround is intended to help protect against Web based exploit vectors and is not effective against exploits that have Windows Metafile images embedded in Word documents and other similar attack vectors.
  
    **Note** The following steps require Administrative privileges. We recommend that you restart the computer after you apply this workaround. Alternatively, you can log out and log back in after you apply the workaround. However, we do recommend that you restart the computer.
  
    To un-register Shimgvw.dll, follow these steps:
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**regsvr32 -u %windir%\\system32\\shimgvw.dll**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.  
    2.  When a dialog box appears that confirms that the process has been successful, click **OK**.
  
    **Impact of Workaround:** The Windows Picture and Fax Viewer will no longer start when users click a link to an image type that is associated with the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer.
  
    To undo this workaround after the security update has been deployed, reregister Shimgvw.dll. To do this, use this same procedure, but replace the text in step 1 with **“regsvr32 %windir%\\system32\\shimgvw.dll”** (without the quotation marks).
