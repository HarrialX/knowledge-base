Workarounds for PowerPoint Temporary Internet Files Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0004:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Back up and remove the vnd.ms-powerpoint MIME type
Removing the vnd.ms-powerpoint registry key helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To backup and remove the vnd.ms-powerpoint registry key, follow these steps:
Note Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
Note We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.

Click Start, click Run, type “regedit" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.
Expand HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type, and then clickapplication/vnd.ms-powerpoint.
Click File, and then click Export.
In the Export Registry File dialog box, type a file name in the File Name box, and then click Save.
Click Edit, and then click Delete to remove the registry key.
In the Confirm Key Delete dialog box, you receive an “Are you sure you want to delete this key and all of its subkeys” message. Click Yes.



Impact of Workaround: This workaround removes the MIME entry point for PowerPoint.
