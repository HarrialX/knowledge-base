#### Workarounds for File Change Notification Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0074
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **On Windows Server 2003, stop the FTP and NNTP services**
  
    Exploitation of this vulnerability would require that the attacker have write access to the FTP root or NNTP root folders. By default the IIS anonymous access account, IUSR\_MACHINENAME, has write access to the FTP root and NNTP root folders. Stopping these services will prevent the FTP and NNTP services from responding to change notifications for files in those directories. To stop the FTP and NNTP services, follow these steps:
  
    From a command prompt, run the following commands:
  
    `net stop msftpsvc`
    
    `net stop nntpsvc`
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Users will be unable to use the FTP and NNTP services.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.** To undo the workaround, follow these steps:
  
    From a command prompt, run the following commands:
  
    `net start msftpsvc`
    
    `net start nntpsvc`
  
-   **Deny write access to the NNTP root, FTP root, and WWW root folders for any accounts that are used to execute user controlled ASP pages.**
  
    Verify that the WWW root folder does not allow write access for any accounts used to execute user controlled ASP pages. To deny write access to the NNTP root, FTP root, and WWW root folders follow these steps:
    
    **Note** The ACLs of the WWW root folder should be verified to ensure that anonymous access user accounts do not have write access.
    
    **Note** The following commands will deny the IIS anonymous user account write access to the default FTP and NNTP root directories of a machine named WS2003ENTSP1.
  
    From a command prompt, run the following commands:
  
    cacls c:\\inetpub\\ftproot /E /P IUSR\_WS2003ENTSP1:R  
cacls c:\\inetpub\\ftproot /E /P USERS:R  

cacls c:\\inetpub\\nntpfile\\root /E /P "ANONYMOUS LOGON":R  

cacls c:\\inetpub\\nntpfile\\root /E /P EVERYONE:R

**Impact of workaround.** Users will be denied write access to the NNTP root, FTP root, and WWW root folders for any accounts that are used to execute user-controlled ASP pages.

**How to undo the workaround.** Restore the ACLs on the folders to their previously configured setting.
