Workarounds for Compressed (zipped) Folders Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0575:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

Remove the registration for Compressed (zipped) Folders, to help protect yourself from the Web based attack vector.
To remove the registration for Compressed (zipped) Folders, follow these steps:

Click Start, click Run, type "regsvr32 /u zipfldr.dll" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

A dialog box appears to confirm that the unregistration process has succeeded. Click OK to close the dialog box.

Immediately restart the system.
Note: If .zip files are used in any way before you restart the system, they may automatically restore the registration.
Impact of Workaround: Compressed (zipped) Folder functionality will be unavailable. This will prevent the use of any Compressed (zipped) Folders that have been created. This will not affect any third-party compression applications. To restore this feature, use the same steps provided, but remove ‘/u’ from the command line.



Install Outlook E-mail Security Update if you are using Outlook 2000 SP1 or earlier, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.
By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002 and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018 has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or later, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or later, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.
Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or later and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.
Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about enabling this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594.
For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387.
Impact of Workaround: E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. In addition:

The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.


Do not open or save .zip files that you receive from untrusted sources.
This vulnerability could be exploited when a user views a .zip file. Do not open files that use this file name extension if the files are from untrusted sources. Administrators may want to consider restricting the use of .zip files as email attachments.
