#### Workarounds for Outlook Express and Windows Mail Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0816
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Use web-based e-mail when possible**
  
    If available, use web-based e-mail instead of IMAP or POP3 to check e-mail.
