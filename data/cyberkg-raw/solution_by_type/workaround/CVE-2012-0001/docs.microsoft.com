#### Workarounds for Windows Kernel SafeSEH Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0001
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Recompile** **software** **using** **a newer version of** **Microsoft Visual** **C++**
  
    Only software applications that were compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ .NET 2003 can be used to exploit this vulnerability. To work around this issue, recompile the model using Microsoft Visual C++ 2005, Microsoft Visual C++ 2008, or Microsoft Visual C++ 2010.
  
-   **Enable** **Structured Exception Handling Overwrite Protection (SEHOP)**
  
    For Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 systems, see [How to enable Structured Exception Handling Overwrite Protection (SEHOP) in Windows operating systems](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/956607) for instructions on enabling SEHOP for existing applications.
