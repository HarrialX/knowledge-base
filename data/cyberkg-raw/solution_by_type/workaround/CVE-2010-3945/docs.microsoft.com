Workarounds for CGM Image Converter Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3945
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Modify the Access Control List to deny access to cgmimp32.flt for all users
Run the following command from a command prompt as an administrator:
For all supported 32-bit editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003:
cacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\grphflt\cgmimp32.flt" /E /P everyone:N
For all supported 64-bit editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003:
cacls "%CommonProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Shared\grphflt\cgmimp32.flt" /E /P everyone:N
For all supported 32-bit editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and Windows 7:
takeown /f "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\grphflt\cgmimp32.flt" 

icacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\grphflt\cgmimp32.flt" /save %TEMP%\cgmflt_ACL.TXT 

icacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\grphflt\cgmimp32.flt" /deny everyone:(F)

For all supported 64-bit editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2:
