#### Workarounds for Remote Desktop Protocol Vulnerability - CVE-2012-2526
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Block TCP port 3389 at the enterprise perimeter firewall**
  
    TCP port 3389 is used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking this port at the network perimeter firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. This can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Blocking the affected ports at the enterprise perimeter is the best defense to help avoid Internet-based attacks. However, systems could still be vulnerable to attacks from within their enterprise perimeter.
  
    On Windows XP, the Windows Firewall can help protect individual systems. By default, the Windows Firewall does not allow connections to this port, except in Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Service Pack 3 when the Remote Desktop feature is enabled. For information about how to disable the Windows Firewall exception for Remote Desktop on these platforms, see the TechNet article, [Enable or Disable the Remote Desktop Firewall Rule](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc736451.aspx). If you cannot disable the Windows Firewall exception for Remote Desktop, you may be able to reduce the scope of this vulnerability by setting the default value of all computers (including those on the Internet), to the local network. Doing this helps reduce the likelihood of attacks from the Internet.
          
    **Note**Â It is possible to manually change the affected components to use other ports. If you have performed these actions, you should also block those additional ports.
  
-   **Disable Remote Desktop feature if no longer required**
  
    If you no longer need these services on your system, consider disabling them as a security best practice. Disabling unused and unneeded services helps reduce your exposure to security vulnerabilities.
