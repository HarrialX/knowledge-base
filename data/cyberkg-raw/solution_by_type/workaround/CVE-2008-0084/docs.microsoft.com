#### Workarounds for Windows Vista TCP/IP Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0084
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   Assign a static IP address to the client computer instead of allowing the client computer to automatically request an IP address. Perform the following steps:
  
    1.  On the client computer, click **Control Panel**, then click **Network and Sharing Center**.  
    2.  **Local Area Connection** and click **View** **Status**.  
    3.  Click **Properties**.  
    4.  Click **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** and click **Properties**.  
    5.  Select **Use the following IP address** and enter the values in **IP address**, **Subnet mask**, **Default gateway**, and **Preferred DNS server**.  
    6.  Click **OK**.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Automatic requests for an IP address have been bypassed.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.** Re-enable automatic requests for an IP address by performing the following steps:
  
    1.  On the client computer, click **Control Panel**, then click **Network and Sharing Center** or **Network Connections**.  
    2.  **Local Area Connection** and click **View** **Status**.  
    3.  Click **Properties**.  
    4.  Click **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** click **Properties**.  
    5.  Select **Obtain an IP address automatically**.  
    6.  Click **OK**.
