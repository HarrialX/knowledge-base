Instructions:
Possible workarounds to avoid a DNS hijacking attack follow: 


    Turn off automatic updates and manually verify that the support.sourcefire.com host resolves to one of the IP addresses from the pool (listed in this section) before manually initiating an update of the rules

    Configure the firewall to allow the IP address of the MC to connect externally only toward a limited set of addresses, including the support.sourcefire.com address pool (listed in this section) and 198.148.79.58 (intelligence.sourcefire.com)
