Workarounds for Table Conversion Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0571:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

Do not open Word for Windows 6.0 documents using Microsoft WordPad.
Do not open Word for Windows 6.0 documents from untrusted sources using any software listed as affected in this bulletin on systems that are not updated with the security updates that accompany this bulletin. This includes files that have .wri, .rtf, and .doc file associations. WordPad could also be used to manually open malicious documents; this could include files with file name extensions other than .wri, .rtf, and .doc because WordPad will process the malicious document the same regardless of the file name extension.

Use Microsoft Word to open the Word for Windows 6.0 document.
This vulnerability is not present in any supported version of Microsoft Word. If Microsoft Word is installed, use that application to open the Word for Windows 6.0 document. This includes files that have .rtf and .doc file associations.

On Windows 2000 and Windows XP Service Pack 1, disable the handler for Word for Windows 6.0 converter:
Deleting this registry key will help reduce attacks by preventing WordPad from processing Word for Windows 6.0 documents.
