#### Workarounds for Visio Object Header Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1089
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   Use Microsoft Visio 2003 Viewer or Microsoft Visio 2007 Viewer to open and view Visio files. Microsoft Visio 2003 Viewer and Microsoft Visio 2007 Viewer are not affected by the issue.  
-   Do not open or save Visio files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.
  
#### Workarounds for Visio Memory Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1090
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Disable Visio from opening .DXF file by restricting access to DWGDP.DLL.**  
    To restrict access to DWGDP.DLL, type the following at the command prompt:    
    **Note** For Vista, an account with administrator privileges is required to implement this workaround.  
    **For Windows XP**  
    Echo y|cacls "%ProgramFiles%\\microsoft office\\visio11\\dll\\dwgdp.dll" /D everyone  
    **For Windows Vista**  
    Takeown.exe /f "%ProgramFiles%\\microsoft office\\visio11\\dll\\dwgdp.dll"  
    Icacls.exe "%ProgramFiles%\\microsoft office\\visio11\\dll\\dwgdp.dll" /save %TEMP%\\DWGDP\_ACL.TXT  
    Icacls.exe "%ProgramFiles%\\microsoft office\\visio11\\dll\\dwgdp.dll" /deny everyone:(F)  
    **Impact of Workaround:** The impact of implementing this workaround is that Visio will no longer open AutoCAD drawing files (.DXF). If you have no need to open AutoCAD drawing files, this workaround should have no impact to your systemâ€™s functionality.  
    **How to Undo the Workaround**: To rollback this workaround, type the following at the command prompt:  
    **For Windows XP**  
    cacls "%ProgramFiles%\\microsoft office\\visio11\\dll\\dwgdp.dll" /G everyone  
    **For Windows** **Vista**  
    Icacls "%ProgramFiles%\\microsoft office\\visio11\\dll\\dwgdp.dll" /grant everyone:(F)  
    Icacls "%ProgramFiles%\\microsoft office\\visio11\\dll\\dwgdp.dll" /restore %TEMP%\\DWGDP\_ACL.TXT  
-   **Use Microsoft Visio 2003 Viewer or Microsoft Visio 2007 Viewer to open and view Visio files.** Microsoft Visio 2003 Viewer and Microsoft Visio 2007 Viewer are not affected by the issue.  
-   **Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources.** This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.
