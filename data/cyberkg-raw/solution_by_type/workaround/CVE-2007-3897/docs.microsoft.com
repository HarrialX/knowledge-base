Workarounds for Network News Transfer Protocol Memory Corruption â€“ CVE-2007-3897
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Disable news protocol handler.
You can disable the news protocol handler by removing the application associated with it in the registry.
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
Paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\news\shell\open\command]
@=""
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\snews\shell\open\command]
@=""
You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:

Group Policy collection
What is Group Policy Object Editor?
Core Group Policy tools and settings

Impact of workaround: This workaround removes the associated application that is used to run NNTP.

Remove News Accounts.
Removing all registered news accounts in Outlook Express or Windows Mail client.

In Windows Mail or Outlook Express select the Tools menu and then Accounts
Select a News account and click remove then OK or Yes
Repeat step 2 for all News accounts

**Impact of workaround:**Removing newsgroups that have been registered will make them unavailable for use unless you reregister them again.
