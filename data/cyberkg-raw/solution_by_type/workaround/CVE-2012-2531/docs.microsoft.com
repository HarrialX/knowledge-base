Workarounds for Password Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2012-2531
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

If you have enabled the "Operational" log for IIS, disable the "Operational" log for IIS-Configuration before assigning a custom account to an Application Pool, and re-enable the "Operational" log after the account has been associated.
Use Built-in account identities (e.g. LocalService, ApplicationPoolIdentity, etc.) instead of custom accounts for application pools when possible.
Prevent access to EventViewer snap-in to non-Administrators accounts.
