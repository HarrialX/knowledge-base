Workarounds for TNEF Decoding Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0002:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Block MS-TNEF on Microsoft Exchange Server to help protect against attempts to exploit this vulnerability through SMTP e-mail.
Systems can be configured to block certain types of files from being received as e-mail attachments. Microsoft TNEF-encoded e-mail messages, commonly known as rich text format (RTF) e-mail messages, can contain malicious OLE objects. These e-mail messages contain a file attachment that stores the TNEF information. This file attachment is usually named Winmail.dat. Blocking this file, and blocking the ms-tnef MIME type, could help protect Exchange servers and other affected programs from attempts to exploit this vulnerability if customers cannot install the available security update. To help protect an Exchange Server computer from attacks through SMTP, block the Winmail.dat file and all application/ms-tnef MIME type content before it reaches the Exchange Server computer.
Note You cannot mitigate this vulnerability by setting the Exchange rich-text format option in Exchange Server to Never used or by disabling TNEF processing by editing the registry.
Note Exchange supports other messaging protocols, such as X.400, that these workarounds do not protect. We recommend that administrators require authentication on all other client and message transport protocols to help prevent attacks using these protocols.
Note Filtering only for attachments that have the file name Winmail.dat may not be sufficient to help protect your system. A malicious file attachment could be given another file name that could then be processed by the Exchange Server computer. To help protect against malicious e-mail messageâ€™s, block all application/ms-tnef MIME type content.
There are many ways to block the Winmail.dat file and other TNEF content. Here are some suggestions:

You can use ISA Server 2000 SMTP Message Screener to block all file attachments or to block only the Winmail.dat file. Blocking all file attachments provides the most protection for this issue if you use ISA Server 2000 because ISA Server 2000 does not support blocking content based on MIME content types. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 315132.
You can use ISA Server 2000 SMTP Filter to block all file attachments or to block only the Winmail.dat file. Blocking all file attachments provides the most protection for this issue if you use ISA Server 2000 because ISA Server 2000 does not support blocking content based on MIME content types. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 320703.
You can use ISA Server 2004 SMTP Filter and Message Screener block all file attachments or just the Winmail.dat file. Blocking all file attachments provides the most protection for this issue if you use ISA Server 2004 because ISA Server 2004 does not support blocking content based on MIME content types. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 888709.
You can use third-party e-mail filters to block all application/ms-tnef MIME type content before it is sent to the Exchange Server computer or to a vulnerable application.

Impact of workaround: If TNEF attachments are blocked, e-mail messages that are formatted as RTF will not be received correctly. In some cases, users could receive blank e-mail messages instead of the original RTF-formatted e-mail message. In other cases, users may not receive e-mail messages that are formatted as RTF at all. Blocking the TNEF attachments will not affect e-mail messages that are formatted as HTML or that are formatted as plain text. Perform this workaround only if you cannot install the available security update or if a security update is not publicly available for your configuration.

Require authentication for connections to a server that is running Microsoft Exchange Server for all client and message transport protocols.
Requiring authentication for all connections made to the Exchange Server computer will help protect against anonymous attacks. This will not protect against an attack from a malicious user who can successfully authenticate.
Impact of workaround: Anonymous communication from clients through IMAP, POP3, HTTP, LDAP, SMTP, and NNTP will no longer be possible. Server to server anonymous communication through RPC, X.400, foreign gateway, and third-party connector protocols will also no longer be possible. In most configurations of Exchange Server, authenticated access is already required for all protocols except SMTP. If all application/ms-tnef MIME type message parts and the Winmail.dat file are blocked, as described in the previous workaround, anonymous SMTP connections could still be accepted.

Do not accept incoming public newsfeeds through the NNTP protocol on Microsoft Exchange Server.
Incoming newsfeeds are not enabled by default for Exchange Server. If you have subscribed to incoming newsfeeds from public newsgroups, an attacker could post a malicious message to such a newsgroup. Even if you require authentication between the news server and your Exchange Server computer, such a message could still be transferred to your Exchange Server computer. Therefore, you should disable incoming newsfeeds from any NNTP server that could let a user post a malicious message.
Impact of workaround: Exchange access to public newsgroup feeds will no longer be possible.
