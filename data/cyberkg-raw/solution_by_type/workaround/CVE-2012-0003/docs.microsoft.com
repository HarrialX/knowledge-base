Workarounds for MIDI Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0003
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Disable MIDI parsing
Note If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys and Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
To disable MIDI parsing, perform the following steps:

Back up the original MIDI parser registry value using the following command at an elevated command prompt:
regedit /e Backup.reg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{D51BD5A2-7548-11CF-A520-0080C77EF58A}


Unregister the MIDI parser using a .reg file with the following contents:
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{D51BD5A2-7548-11CF-A520-0080C77EF58A}]



Impact of workaround. MIDI file playback is disabled.
