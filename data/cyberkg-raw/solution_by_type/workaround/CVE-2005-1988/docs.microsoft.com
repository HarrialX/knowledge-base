Workarounds for JPEG Image Rendering Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1988:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Microsoft Outlook 2002 or a later version, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or a later version, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.
Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.
Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594.
For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387.
Impact of Workaround: E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.



Workarounds for Web Folder Behaviors Cross-Domain Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1989:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in these zones.
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:
1.  On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
2.  In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
3.  Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.  

Note If no slider is visible, click Default Level, and then move the slider to High.
Note Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the high security setting.
Impact of Workaround: There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click Yes to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the "Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites" workaround.

Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running ActiveX controls or disable ActiveX controls in the Internet and Local intranet security zone
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls only. To do this, follow these steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the Tools menu.
Click the Security tab.
Click Internet, and then click Custom Level.
Under Settings, in the ActiveX controls and plug-ins section, under Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins, click Prompt.
In the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click Prompt, and then click OK.
Click Local intranet, and then click Custom Level.
Under Settings, in the ActiveX controls and plug-ins section, under Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins, click Prompt.
In the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click Prompt.
Click OK two times to return to Internet Explorer.

Impact of Workaround: There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click Yes to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the "Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites" workaround.

Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites.
After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.


To do this, follow these steps:
1.  In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
2.  In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
3.  If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
4.  In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
5.  Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
6.  Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.  

Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. One in particular that you may want to add is "*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" (without the quotation marks). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX control to install the update.
Workarounds for COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1990:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. The workarounds are mutually exclusive. Users need only apply one workaround. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running ActiveX controls in these zones
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:
1.  On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
2.  In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
3.  Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.  

Note If no slider is visible, click Default Level, and then move the slider to High.
Repeat steps 1 through 3 for the Local intranet security zone by clicking the **Local intranet** icon.

**Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to **High**.

**Impact of Workaround:** User will be prompted prior to running ActiveX controls unless the Web site is in the user’s list of trusted sites.
