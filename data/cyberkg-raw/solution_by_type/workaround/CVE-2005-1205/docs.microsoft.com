Workarounds for Telnet Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1205:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Un-register the default Telnet client:
To help prevent attacks that use Telnet URLs, you can remove the Telnet, Tn3270, and Rlogin handlers. This will prevent Internet Explorer and other applications from automatically launching Telnet sessions.
Note Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
Note We recommend that you back up the registry before you edit it.

Click Start, click Run, type "regedt32" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.
In Registry Editor, delete the following registry keys:
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\telnet\shell\open\command
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\tn3270\shell\open\command
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\rlogin\shell\open\command

Impact of Workaround: These changes will help prevent attacks by blocking Telnet from being used to process Telnet, Tn3270, or Rlogin URLs.
