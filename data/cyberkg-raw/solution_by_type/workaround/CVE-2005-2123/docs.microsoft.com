Workarounds for Graphics Rendering Engine - CAN-2005-2123:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or a later version, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.
Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.
Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594.
Impact of Workaround: E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.
