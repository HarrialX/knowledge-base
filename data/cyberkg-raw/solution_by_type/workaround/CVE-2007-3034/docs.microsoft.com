Workarounds for Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in GDIâ€“ CVE-2007-3034
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Turn off metafile processing by modifying the registry
Customers who have applied MS07-017 or customers using Windows Vista can disable metafile processing by modifying the registry. This setting will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.
To modify the key, follow these steps:
Note: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe

Click Start, click Run, type Regedit in the Open box, and then click OK.

Locate and then click the following registry subkey:


HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\GRE_Initialize

On the Edit menu, point to New, and then click DWORD.

Type DisableMetaFiles, and then press ENTER.

On the Edit menu, click Modify to modify the DisableMetaFiles registry entry.

In the Value data box, type 1, and then click OK.

Exit Registry Editor.


Impact of Workaround: Turning off processing of metafiles may cause the appearance of software or system components to decrease in quality. Turning off processing of metafiles may also cause the software or system components to fail completely. It has been identified to have a potential significant functionality impact and should be evaluated and tested carefully to determine its applicability.
Examples include the following.

You cannot print on the computer.
Some applications on the computer may be unable to display Clipart.
Some scenarios that involve OLE rendering may break. Especially, it occurs when the object server is not active.
