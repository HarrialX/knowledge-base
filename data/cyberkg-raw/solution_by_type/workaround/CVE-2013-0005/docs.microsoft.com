Workarounds for Replace Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2013-0005
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Block OData Web Application ports at the firewall
OData ports are typically hosted on TCP ports 80 and 443, but could be hosted on other non-standard ports as well. Evaluating your environment and blocking inbound and outbound connections to all ports where an OData service is hosted at the enterprise firewall will help protect systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, TCP and UDP Port Assignments.

Require Authentication for clients connecting to IIS
You can enable authentication in IIS to block unauthenticated attackers from exploiting this vulnerability. For information on how to implement authentication in your environment, refer to the TechNet documentation for your version of IIS.
For IIS 7, see Configuring Authentication in IIS 7
For IIS 6.0, see Integrated Windows Authentication in IIS 6.0
