#### Workarounds for Calculation Error Vulnerability - CVE-2007-1756
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or un-trusted sources.**    
    The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when added to the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats is used to more securely open Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files. For more information on MOICE see the following [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865).
  
    **Impact of Workaround**: Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the 2007 Microsoft Office System Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Right Management cannot be converted.
  
    -   **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations.**    
        The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.
    **Note** Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.

    **For Office 2003**

    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

    \[HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\11.0\\Excel\\Security\\FileOpenBlock\]

    "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001.

    **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Office 2003, all of the latest Office 2003 security updates as of May 2007 must be applied.

    **For 2007 Microsoft Office System**

    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\[HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\12.0\\Excel\\Security\\FileOpenBlock\]

    "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001

    **Impact of Workaround:** Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special “exempt directory” as discussed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922848) will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions in Office 2003 or 2007 Microsoft Office System.

-   Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.
