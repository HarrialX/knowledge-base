Workarounds for TCP/IP Zero Window Size Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4609
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature
You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 309798.

To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, such as the Internet Connection Firewall
All supported editions of Windows Vista come with Windows Firewall, a two-way firewall that is automatically enabled.
For all supported editions of Windows Server 2003, use the Internet Connection Firewall feature to help protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet.
To enable the Windows Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, perform the following steps:

Click Start, and then click Control Panel.
Double-click Network Connections and then click Change Windows Firewall Settings.
On the General tab, ensure that the On (recommended) value is selected. This will enable the Windows Firewall.
When the Windows Firewall is enabled, select Don’t allow exceptions to prohibit all incoming traffic.

For Windows Server 2003 systems, configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection using the following steps:

Click Start, and then click Control Panel.
In the default Category View, click Networking and Internet Connections, and then click Network Connections.
Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click Properties.
Click the Advanced tab.
Click to select the Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet check box, and then click OK.

Note If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, click Settings on the Advanced tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services that are required.
