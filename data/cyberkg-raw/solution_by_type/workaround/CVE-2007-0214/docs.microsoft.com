Workarounds for HTML Help ActiveX Control Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0214:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Temporarily prevent the HTML Help ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer
To protect against this vulnerability, set the kill bit for the ActiveX control to
temporarily disable the HTML Help ActiveX and keep it from running in Internet Explorer.
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk.
The CLSID for an ActiveX control is a GUID for that control. You can prevent an ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit so that the control is never called by Internet Explorer. The kill bit is a specific value for the Compatibility Flags DWORD value for the ActiveX control in the registry.
The CLSID for the HTML Help ActiveX control is {52a2aaae-085d-4187-97ea-8c30db990436}
For detailed steps about stopping an ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797. Follow these steps and create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent the HTML Help ActiveX control from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.
Note If you use this workaround you must reset this registry change by removing the same Compatibility Flags registry value. You should do this after you have applied this security update to regain normal functionality supplied by the HTML Help ActiveX control.
Impact of Workaround: Disabling the HTML Help ActiveX control prevents Internet Explorer from instantiating the control. This configuration causes program compatibility issues. Some examples of such issues are:

In Help and Support Center, the Index feature no longer works.
In HTML Help, features such as Related Topics and Shortcuts no longer work.

Features that are provided by the HTML Help control in Enterprise intranet programs no longer work.
