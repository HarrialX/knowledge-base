Workarounds for Web View Script Injection Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2117:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Disable Web View:
Disabling Web View will reduce the ability to maliciously use this feature to perform an attack. To disable Web View, follow these steps:

Click Start, and then click My Computer.
Click Tools menu, and then click Folder Options.
On the General tab, under Tasks, click Use Windows classic folders, and then click OK.

These settings take affect only after you log off the system and then log back on again.
Impact of Workaround: This change will reduce the functionality of Windows Explorer by removing the left hand task pane which contains links to common folders and tasks.

Use the Group Policy settings to disable Web View on all affected systems that do not require this feature:
Disabling Web View will reduce the ability to maliciously use this feature to perform an attack.

Impact of Workaround: This change will reduce the functionality of Windows Explorer by removing the task pane, which contains links to common folders and tasks.

Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the perimeter firewall:
These ports are used to initiate a connection by using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. Blocking outbound SMB traffic at the perimeter firewall will help prevent systems from trying to connect to a malicious file server outside the firewall. For more information about the ports, visit the following Web site.
Impact of Workaround: Computers that are behind the firewall will be unable to access trusted file servers by using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol outside the network.
