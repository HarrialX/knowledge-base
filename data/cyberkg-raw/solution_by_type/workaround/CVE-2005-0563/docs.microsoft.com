Modify the Read.asp file
To modify the Read.asp file, follow these steps.
Note Administrators can modify the Read.asp file.
Note These steps must be performed on each Outlook Web Access server.

Open the Read.asp file in Notepad. This file is located in the following folder:
C:\Exchsrvr\Webdata\<lang>\Forms\Ipm\Note

Locate the following line of code:
<%= bstrBody %>

Note These steps must be performed on each Exchange site.

Start Exchange Administrator.

Expand the Configuration container for the site.

Select the Protocols container for the site.

Open the properties of the HTTP (Web) Site Settings object.

Clear the "Enable Protocol" checkbox.

Wait for the change to replicate, and then verify the change has replicated to each server in the site. To do this, bind to each server in the site by using Exchange Administrator, and then view the “Enabled Protocol” check box setting.
