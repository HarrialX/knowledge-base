#### Workarounds for Oracle Outside In Contains Multiple Exploitable Vulnerabilities
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Disable the Advanced Filter Pack for** **FAST** **Search Server 2010 for** **SharePoint**
  
    On the FAST Search Server 2010 for SharePoint administration server (or single server), perform these steps:
  
    1.  On the **Start** menu, click **All Programs**.  
    2.  Click **Microsoft FAST Search Server 2010 for SharePoint**.  
    3.  Right-click **Microsoft FAST Search Server 2010 for SharePoint shell** and select **Run as administrator**.  
    4.  At the command prompt, browse to **installer\\scripts** under the installation folder.  
    5.  Type the following command:
  
        `.\AdvancedFilterPack.ps1 -disable`
