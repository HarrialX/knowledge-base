#### Workarounds for ISATAP IPv6 Source Address Spoofing Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0812
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Block IP Protocol Type 41 (ISATAP) at the firewall**
  
    The ISATAP protocol is defined as protocol type 41 by [RFC4214: Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP)](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4214.txt). Blocking this protocol type at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports or protocols.
  
-   **Disable the ISATAP IPv6 interface**
  
    To disable the ISATAP IPv6 interface, run the following command from an elevated command prompt:
  
    `netsh interface isatap set state disabled`
  
    **Note** You must be logged in as administrator or have administrative credentials to complete this workaround.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Disabling the ISATAP interface will prevent the system from using ISATAP as an IPv6 tunneling mechanism.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    To re-enable the ISATAP IPv6 interface, run the following command from an elevated command prompt:
  
    `netsh interface isatap set state enabled`
  
    **Note** You must be logged in as administrator or have administrative credentials to undo this workaround.
