Workarounds for Assembly Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0013
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Remove the .application file association
Note If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys and Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
To remove the .application file association, perform the following steps:
Using the interactive method

Click Start, click Run, type regedit, and then click OK.
Expand HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, click .application, and then click the File menu and select Export.
In the Export Registry File dialog box, type application HKCR file association registry backup.reg and click Save.
Note This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default**.**
Press the Delete key on the keyboard to delete the registry key. When prompted to delete the registry value, click Yes.
Expand HKEY_CURRENT_USER, then Software, then Microsoft, then Windows, then CurrentVersion, then Explorer, and then FileExts.
Click .application, and then click the File menu and select Export.
In the Export Registry File dialog box, type application HKCU file association registry backup.reg and click Save.
Note This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default**.**
Press the Delete key on the keyboard to delete the registry key. When prompted to delete the registry value, click Yes.

Using a managed deployment script

Make a backup copy of the registry keys using the following command:
Regedit.exe /e application_HKCR_registry_backup.reg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.application
Regedit.exe /e application_HKCU_registry_backup.reg 
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.application


Save the following to a file with a .REG extension (for example, Delete_Application_File_Association.reg):
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.application]
[-HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.application]


Run the registry script created in the previous step with the following command:
Regedit.exe /s Delete_Application_File_Association.reg



Impact of workaround.Â This workaround removes the .application file association. Double-clicking an application file will no longer launch the application.
How to undo the workaround.
Using the interactive method

Click Start, click Run, type Regedit in the Open box, and then click OK.
Click the File menu and select Import.
In the Import Registry File dialog box, select application HKCR file association registry backup.reg and click Open.
Click the File menu and select Import.
In the Import Registry File dialog box, select application HKCU file association registry backup.reg and click Open.

Using a managed deployment script
Restore the original state by running the following commands:
Regedit.exe /s application_HKCR_registry_backup.reg
Regedit.exe /s application_HKCU_registry_backup.reg
