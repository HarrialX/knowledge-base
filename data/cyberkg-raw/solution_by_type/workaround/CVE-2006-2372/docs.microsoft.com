Workarounds for Buffer Overrun in DHCP Client Service Vulnerability- CVE-2006-2372:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Use a static IP address
To configure the system to use a static IP address follow these steps:

Obtain a static IP address from your network administrator
Click Start, and then click Control Panel and then click Network and Internet Connections.
Right-click the connection on which you want to specify to use a static IP address, and then click Properties.
Select Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and click Properties.
On the General tab, click on the Use the following IP address and Use the following DNS server addresses radio buttons.
Input your static IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers.
Click Ok twice.
Repeat steps 3 through 7 for each of your network adapters.


Disable the DHCP Client service
Disabling the DHCP Client service will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To disable the DHCP Client service, follow these steps:

Click Start, and then click Control Panel. Alternatively, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
Double-click Administrative Tools.
Double-click Services.
Double-click DHCP Client.
In the Startup type list, click Disabled.
Click Stop, and then click OK.

You can also stop and disable the DHCP service by using the following command at the command prompt:
sc stop DHCP & sc config DHCP start= disabled
Impact of Workaround: If you disable the DHCP service, you cannot automatically retrieve an IP address from a DHCP Server. Without an IP address you will not be able to connect to the network.
