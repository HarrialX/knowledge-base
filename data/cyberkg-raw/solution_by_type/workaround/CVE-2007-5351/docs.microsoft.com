#### Workarounds for SMBv2 Signing Vulnerability - CVE-2007-5351
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Disable SMBv2**
  
    To disable SMBv2, follow these steps:
      
    **Note**: The following procedure is necessary only if the user wants to use SMB signing. If the user does not want to use SMB signing (the default condition except on a Windows Server 2008 domain), they do not need to do anything.
  
    1.  Create a .reg file with the following contents:  
        Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
        \[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\LanmanWorkstation\]  
        "DependOnService"=hex(7):42,00,6f,00,77,00,73,00,65,00,72,00,00,00,4d,00,52,  
        00,78,00,53,00,6d,00,62,00,31,00,30,00,00,00,4e,00,53,00,49,00,00,00,00,00  
        \[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\LanmanServer\\Parameters\]  
        "Smb2"=dword:00000000  
    2.  Run the .reg file by clicking it.  
    3.  Open a command prompt as Administrator.  
    4.  Run the following command:  
        sc config mrxsmb20 start= disabled  
    5.  Restart the computer.
  
-   **Impact of workaround.** Any performance improvements made to SMBv2 are not available if SMBv2 is disabled.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    To enable SMBv2, follow these steps:
  
    1.  Create a .reg file with the following contents:  
        Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
        \[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\LanmanWorkstation\]  
        "DependOnService"=hex(7):42,00,6f,00,77,00,73,00,65,00,72,00,00,00,4d,00,52,  
        00,78,00,53,00,6d,00,62,00,31,00,30,00,00,00,4d,00,52,00,78,00,53,00,6d,00,62,  
        00,32,00,30,00,00,00,4e,00,53,00,49,00,00,00,00,00  
        \[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\LanmanServer\\Parameters\]  
        "Smb2"=dword:00000001  
    2.  Run the .reg file by double-clicking it.  
    3.  Open a command prompt as Administrator.  
    4.  Run the following command:  
        sc config mrxsmb20 start= demand  
    5.  Restart the computer.
