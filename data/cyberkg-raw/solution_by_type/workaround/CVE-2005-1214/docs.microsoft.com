Workarounds for Microsoft Agent Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1214:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to “High” to disable running ActiveX controls in these zones.
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to disable running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.
To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click Internet Options.
In the Internet Options dialog box, click the Security tab, and then click the Internet icon.
Under Security level for this zone, move the slider to High. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.
Repeat step 1 through step 3 and select the Local intranet security zone.

Note If no slider is visible, click Default Level, and then move the slider to High.
Note Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the high security setting. See the “Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites” workaround for information about how you can add sites to the Trusted sites zone.
Alternatively, you can change your settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls only. To do this, follow these steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the Tools menu.
Click the Security tab.
Click Internet, and then click Custom Level.
Under Settings, in the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click Prompt, and then click OK.
Click Local intranet, and then click Custom Level.
Under Settings, in the ActiveX Controls and Plug-ins section, under Run ActiveX controls and plugs-ins, click Prompt.
Click OK two times to return to Internet Explorer.

Impact of Workaround: There are side effects to disabling running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX controls to provide additional functionality. Disabling running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to disable ActiveX controls for all sites, use the "Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites" workaround.

Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites.
After you set Internet Explorer to disable ActiveX controls in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.
To do this, follow these steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Tools, click Internet Options, and then click the Security tab.
In the Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings box, click Trusted Sites, and then click Sites.
If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone check box.
In the Add this Web site to the zone box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click Add.
Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
Click OK two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. One in particular that you may want to add is "*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" (without the quotation marks). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX control to install the update.
