#### Workarounds for Web Services on Devices API Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2512
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Block inbound TCP ports 5357 and 5358, and outbound UDP port 3702**
  
    Configure the Windows Firewall to block inbound TCP ports 5357 and 5358, and outbound UDP port 3702.
  
    Blocking the inbound ports prevents malicious remote hosts from sending specially crafted headers to the affected component. The affected computer may also initiate a connection with remote, potentially malicious, hosts when the user chooses to browse devices on the subnet. Blocking the outbound port will prevent malicious hosts from sending specially crafted replies in this scenario.
  
    It should be noted that it will still be possible for a user to manually enter the URL of a malicious device and initiate a connection that could allow the malicious device to compromise the user's system. This attack would require significant social engineering.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Device discovery will not work while this workaround is enabled.
