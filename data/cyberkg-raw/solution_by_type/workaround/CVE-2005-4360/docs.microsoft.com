#### Workarounds for IIS Memory Request Vulnerability - CVE-2005-4360
  
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section. It is recommended that customers use versions of IIS included in server editions of Windows and use the version of IIS included in Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 for development and testing of Web sites and Web pages.
  
-   **Use URLScan 2.5**   
    The installation of [URLScan](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/urlscan.mspx) helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.  
    1.  Install URLScan, using the default URLScan.ini settings.  
    2.  Restart the IISAdmin and WWW Publishing services for the changes to take effect.  
-   **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, block access to port 80 (TCP) using:**
  
    -   Windows Firewall.  
    -   Internet Protocol security (IPSec). Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).
  
    Additional ports where Web content is hosted by IIS should also be blocked.
