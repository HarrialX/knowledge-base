Workarounds for IGMP v3 DoS Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0021:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Disable IGMP
Disabling IGMP will prevent an affected host from processing IGMP related packets that could cause a system to stop responding. IGMP processing can be disabled by following these steps:
Note Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
Note We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.

Click Start, click Run, type "regedit32 " (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.
In Registry Editor, locate the following registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\
Add the DWORD Value: IGMPLevel. Set the value to 0. This value disables IGMP processing. By default, this key does not exist.
You must restart your system for this change to take effect.


Block all IGMP network packets at the firewall or router
Blocking IGMP packets at the firewall or at the router will help protect systems that are behind that firewall or router from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet. ISA Server 2000 and ISA Server 2004 can be used to block the affected types of traffic.
Impact of Workaround: These changes will help prevent attacks by restricting the ability of an attacker to send malformed IGMP packets to the affected host. This setting can also negatively impact network performance and communication by preventing the ability of routers to properly forward packets between subnets.
Note Windows Firewall will help protect against attacks utilizing a unicast IGMP v3 packet, however, it will not help protect against an attack utilizing a multicast IGMP v3 packet.
