Workarounds for HTML Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3340
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones
You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.
To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click Internet Options.
In the Internet Options dialog box, click the Security tab, and then click the Internet icon.
Under Security level for this zone, move the slider to High. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

Note If no slider is visible, click Default Level, and then move the slider to High.
Note Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.
Impact of workaround. There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".
Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone
After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.
To do this, follow these steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Tools, click Internet Options, and then click the Security tab.
In the Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings box, click Trusted Sites, and then click Sites.
If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone check box.
In the Add this Web site to the zone box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click Add.
Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
Click OK two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

Note Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are *.windowsupdate.microsoft.com and *.update.microsoft.com. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone
You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the Tools menu.
Click the Security tab.
Click Internet, and then click Custom Level.
Under Settings, in the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click **Prompt **or Disable, and then click OK.
Click Local intranet, and then click Custom Level.
Under Settings, in the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click **Prompt **or Disable, and then click OK.
Click OK two times to return to Internet Explorer.

Note Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.
Impact of workaround. There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click Yes to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".
Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone
After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.
To do this, follow these steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Tools, click Internet Options, and then click the Security tab.
In the Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings box, click Trusted Sites, and then click Sites.
If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone check box.
In the Add this Web site to the zone box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click Add.
Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
Click OK two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

Note Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are *.windowsupdate.microsoft.com and *.update.microsoft.com. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.


Workarounds for Cross-Domain Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3342
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Read e-mails in plain text
To help protect yourself from the e-mail attack vector, read e-mail messages in plain text format.
Microsoft Office Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Office Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.
Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594.
For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387.
Impact of workaround. E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

Workarounds for Cross-Domain Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3348
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Read e-mails in plain text
To help protect yourself from the e-mail attack vector, read e-mail messages in plain text format.
Microsoft Office Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Office Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.
Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594.
For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387.
Impact of workaround. E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.


Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones
You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.
To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click Internet Options.
In the Internet Options dialog box, click the Security tab, and then click the Internet icon.
Under Security level for this zone, move the slider to High. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

Note If no slider is visible, click Default Level, and then move the slider to High.
Note Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.
Impact of workaround. There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".
Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone
After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.
To do this, follow these steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Tools, click Internet Options, and then click the Security tab.
In the Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings box, click Trusted Sites, and then click Sites.
If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone check box.
In the Add this Web site to the zone box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click Add.
Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
Click OK two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

Note Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are *.windowsupdate.microsoft.com and *.update.microsoft.com. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone
You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the Tools menu.
Click the Security tab.
Click Internet, and then click Custom Level.
Under Settings, in the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click **Prompt **or Disable, and then click OK.
Click Local intranet, and then click Custom Level.
Under Settings, in the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click **Prompt **or Disable, and then click OK.
Click OK two times to return to Internet Explorer.

Note Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.
Impact of workaround. There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click Yes to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".
Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone
After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.
To do this, follow these steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Tools, click Internet Options, and then click the Security tab.
In the Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings box, click Trusted Sites, and then click Sites.
If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone check box.
In the Add this Web site to the zone box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click Add.
Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
Click OK two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

Note Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are *.windowsupdate.microsoft.com and *.update.microsoft.com. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.


Workarounds for Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3962
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Override the Web site CSS with a user-defined style sheet
To apply a custom cascading style sheet (CSS) for formatting documents loaded in Internet Explorer, save the following text to a file with a .CSS extension, such as KB2458511.CSS:
TABLE
{
    POSI\TION: relative !important;
}
Note The "\" literal that appears between "POSI" and "TION" above is intentional.
Impact of workaround. Applying a user-defined CSS may cause Web site style sheets to malfunction. If you previously applied this workaround, this workaround must be reversed before applying this security update. Use the automated Microsoft Fix it solution in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2458511 to disable this workaround.
To apply the change interactively

In Internet Explorer, click Tools, then Internet Options.
On the General tab, click the Accessibility button.
Select Format documents using my style sheet, click Browse, then browse to location of the above file and select the file.
Click Open, click OK twice, then restart Internet Explorer.

How to undo the workaround. Repeat the steps above except that for step 3, clear the Format documents using my style sheet box.
To apply the change using the Registry Editor
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Create a backup copy of the registry keys by using the following command from an elevated command prompt:
regedit /e CSS-backup.reg "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Styles"
If no CSS-backup.reg was created, it means that there is no user-defined CSS.
Next, save the following to a file with a .REG extension, such as Apply_user_CSS.reg:
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Styles]
"User Stylesheet"="C:\\[directory location]\\KB2458511.css"
"Use My Stylesheet"=dword:00000001
Note The [directory location] must match the location of the KB2458511.css on the local system.
Then run Apply_user_CSS.reg to apply the setting.

How to undo the workaround. If a previous user-defined CSS existed, use the CSS-backup.reg file to restore the previous setting. If not, save the following to a file with a .REG extension, such as Remove_user_CSS.reg:
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[-HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Styles]
Then run Remove_user_CSS.reg with the following command from an elevated command prompt:
Regedit.exe /s Remove_user_CSS.reg
To apply the change using the automated Microsoft Fix it solution
See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2458511 to use the automated Microsoft Fix it solution to enable or disable this workaround.

Enable Data Execution Prevention (DEP) for Internet Explorer 7
Local Administrators can control DEP/NX by running Internet Explorer as an Administrator. To enable DEP, use one of the following methods:
Enable DEP for Internet Explorer 7 interactively

In Internet Explorer, click Tools, click Internet Options, and then click Advanced.
Click Enable memory protection to help mitigate online attacks.

Impact of workaround. Some browser extensions may not be compatible with DEP and may exit unexpectedly.
How to undo workaround. If this occurs, you can disable the add-on, or revert the DEP setting using the Internet Control Panel. This is also accessible using the System Control panel.
Enable DEP for Internet Explorer 7 using automated Microsoft Fix It
See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2458511 to use the automated Microsoft Fix it solution to enable or disable this workaround.
Impact of workaround. Some browser extensions may not be compatible with DEP and may exit unexpectedly.
How to undo the workaround. If this occurs, you can disable the add-on, or revert the DEP setting using the automated Microsoft Fix it solution to disable the workaround.

Read e-mails in plain text
