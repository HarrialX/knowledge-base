Workarounds for Windows Shell Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0012:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Disable the Web Client service
Disabling the Web Client service will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To disable the Web Client service, follow these steps:

Click Start, and then click Control Panel. Alternatively, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
Double-click Administrative Tools.
Double-click Services.
Double-click WebClient.
In the Startup type list, click Disabled.
Click Stop, and then click OK.

You can also stop and disable the Web Client service by using the following command at the command prompt:
sc stop WebClient & sc config WebClient start= disabled
Impact of Workaround: If the Web Client service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. If the Web Client service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. Windows Server 2003 users will not be able to use the "Open as Web Folder" functionality.

Use the Group Policy settings to disable the WebClient service on all affected systems that do not require this feature.
Because the Web Client service is a possible attack vector, disable the service by using the Group Policy settings. You can disable the startup of this service at either the local, site, domain, or organizational-unit level by using Group Policy object functionality in Windows 2000 domain environments or in Windows Server 2003 domain environments.
Note You may also review the Windows Server 2003 Security Guide. This guide includes information about how to disable services.

Impact of Workaround: If the Web Client service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. If the Web Client service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. Windows Server 2003 users will not be able to use the "Open as Web Folder" functionality.

Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall:
Although WebDAV uses TCP port 80 for outbound communication, TCP ports 139 and 445 can be used outbound to attempt to connect to a malicious service and try to exploit this vulnerability. Blocking them at the firewall can help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports.
