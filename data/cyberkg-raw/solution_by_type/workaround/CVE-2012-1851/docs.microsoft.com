Workarounds for Remote Administration Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1850
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Disable the LanmanWorkstation service
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
We recommend that you back up the registry before you edit it.
Using the interactive method:

Click Start, click Run, type regedit, and then click OK.

In Registry Editor, expand the following registry location:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\

Select LanmanWorkstation, and then click the File menu and select Export.

In the Export Registry File dialog, type lanmanworkstation_configuration_backup.reg, and then click Save.

Double-click the Start registry entry, change the Valuedata field to 4, and then click OK.

Run the following command at a command prompt running as an administrator:
sc stop lanmanworkstation


Using a managed deployment script:

Make a backup copy of the registry keys using a managed deployment script with the following command:
regedit /e lanmanworkstation_configuration_backup.reg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\lanmanworkstation

Save the following script to a file with a .REG extension (e.g., Disable_lanmanworkstation.reg):
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\lanmanworkstation]
"Start"=dword:00000004

Run the registry script created in step 2 on the target machine with the following command:
Regedit /s Disable_lanmanworkstation.reg

Run the following command at a command prompt running as an administrator:
sc stop lanmanworkstation


How to undo the workaround.
Using the interactive method:

Click Start, click Run, type regedit, and then click OK.
Click the File menu and select Import.
In the Import Registry File dialog, select lanmanworkstation_configuration_backup.reg, and then click Open.

Using a managed deployment script:
Restore the original state by running the following command:
Regedit /s lanmanworkstation_configuration_backup.reg


Workarounds for Print Spooler Service Format String Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1851
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Disable the Print Spooler service
Disabling the Print Spooler service will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To disable the Print Spooler service, follow these steps:
Interactive method:
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Click Start, click Run, type regedit, and then click OK.

In Registry Editor, expand the following registry location:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\

Select Print Spooler, and then click the File menu and select Export.

In the Export Registry File dialog, type spooler_configuration_backup.reg and click Save.

Double-click the registry DWORD entry named Start, change its value to 4, and then click OK.

Run the following command at a command prompt running as an administrator:
sc stop spooler


Using a managed deployment script:

Create a back-up copy of the registry keys using a managed deployment script with the following command:
regedit /e spooler_configuration_backup.reg
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\spooler

Create a text file named Disable_spooler.reg with the following contents:
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Spooler]
"Start"=dword:00000004

Run the registry script created in step 2 on the target machine by using the following command:
Regedit /s Disable_spooler.reg

Run the following command at a command prompt running as an administrator:
sc stop spooler


Impact of workaround. Print-related components will not function properly; printing will be disabled.
How to undo the workaround.
To undo the workaround if applied using the interactive method:

Click Start, click Run, type regedit, and then click OK.
Click the File menu and select Import.
In the Import Registry File dialog select the registry backup file you created (spooler_configuration_backup.reg) and then click Open.

To undo the workaround if applied using the managed deployment script, run the following command at a command prompt running as an administrator:
Regedit /s spooler_configuration_backup.reg
