Workarounds for Microsoft Windows MDAC Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0003:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Disable the RDS.Dataspace ActiveX control from running within Internet Explorer
Disable attempts to instantiate the RDS.Dataspace ActiveX control in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control.

Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
For example, to set the kill bit for a CLSID for this object, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility{BD96C556-65A3-11D0-983A-00C04FC29E36}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword: 00000400
Note For more information about how to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797. Follow the procedure that this article provides to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry. By doing this, you will prevent the RDS.Dataspace ActiveX control from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.
Impact of Workaround: Any Web-based application that requires the RDS control to be instantiated within Internet Explorer will no longer function correctly.

Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running ActiveX controls in these zones
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click Internet Options.
In the Internet Options dialog box, click the Security tab, and then click the Internet icon.
Under Security level for this zone, move the slider to High. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

Note If no slider is visible, click Default Level, and then move the slider to High.
Repeat steps 1 through 3 for the Local intranet security zone by clicking on the Local intranet icon.
Note Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.
Impact of Workaround: User will be prompted prior to running ActiveX controls unless the Web site is in the user’s list of trusted sites.

Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running ActiveX controls or disable ActiveX controls in the Internet and Local intranet security zone
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls or disable ActiveX controls in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:
On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click Internet Options.
In the Internet Options dialog box, click the Security tab, and then click the Internet icon.
Click Custom Level.
Under Settings, in the ActiveX controls and plug-ins section, under Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.
Click Local intranet, and then click Custom Level.
Under Settings, in the ActiveX controls and plug-ins section, under Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.
Click OK two times to return to Internet Explorer.

Impact of Workaround: There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click Yes to run ActiveX controls.
