Workarounds for Word RTF 'listoverridecount' Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2012-2539
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality.

Read emails in plain text
To help protect yourself from the email attack vector, read email messages in plain text format.
Microsoft Outlook 2003, Microsoft Outlook 2007, and Microsoft Outlook 2010 provide an option for reading email messages in plain text format. For more information about the Read all standard mail in plain text option, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 831607.
Microsoft Office Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1, Office XP Service Pack 2, or Office XP Service Pack 3 can enable this setting and view in plain text only those email messages that are not digitally signed or email messages that are not encrypted. Digitally signed email messages or encrypted email messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594.
Impact of workaround. Email messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. In addition, the following behavior may be experienced:

The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.


Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of RTF documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations
Note Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.
For Office 2003 
The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]  
"RtfFiles"=dword:00000001

Note In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2003, all of the latest security updates for Microsoft Office 2003 must be applied.
For Office 2007 
The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]  
"RtfFiles"=dword:00000001

Note In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2007, all of the latest security updates for Microsoft Office 2007 must be applied.
For Microsoft Office 2010

Open Word 2010 and follow the steps below:
Click the File tab.
Under Help, click Options.
Click Trust Center, and then click Trust Center Settings.
In the Trust Center, click File Block Settings.
Ensure that the Open checkbox is selected for the following file types:

RTF Files


Under Open behavior for selected file types, select Do not open selected file types or select Open selected file types in Protected View. Either choice will block the attack vector to the vulnerable code.
Click OK to apply the File Block Settings.

Alternatively, file block can be applied using Group Policy. For more information, see the TechNet article, Plan file block settings for Office 2010.
Impact of workaround. For Microsoft Office 2003 and Microsoft Office 2007, users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special exempt directory or have not moved files to a trusted location will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions. For Microsoft Office 2010, Office 2003 files or earlier versions will either be blocked from opening or will be opened in protected mode depending on the open behavior that was selected. For more information about the impact of file block setting in Microsoft Office software, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922850.
How to undo the workaround.
For Office 2003
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]  
"RtfFiles"=dword:00000000

For Office 2007
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]  
"RtfFiles"=dword:00000000

For Microsoft Office 2010, open Microsoft Word 2010 and perform the following steps:

Click the File tab.
Under Help, click Options.
Click Trust Center, and then click Trust Center Settings.
In the Trust Center, click File Block Settings.
Clear the Open check box for the file types that you previously selected.
Click OK to apply the File Block settings.
