#### Workarounds for Macrovision Driver Vulnerability - CVE-2007-5587
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Disable the secdrv.sys driver**
  
    Disabling the secdrv.sys driver in the system registry key helps protect affected systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.
  
    **Note:** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

    2.  Expand **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE**.  
    3.  Expand **SYSTEM**, expand **CurrentControlSet**, and then expand **Services**.  
    4.  Click **Secdrv**.  
    5.  Click the **File** menu and select **Export**.  
    6.  To backup the registry before your edit it, left click on **File** menu, select **Export...** In the **Export Registry File** dialog box, type **Secdrv\_configuration\_backup.reg** and select **Save**.  
    7.  Double-click the value named **Start**, and change the **Value data:** field to **4**.  
    8.  Click **OK**.  
    9.  Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Accessories**, and click **Command Prompt.**  
    10. Run the following command at a command prompt:
  
    `Sc stop secdrv`
  
    **Managed Deployment Script**
  
    1. Make a backup copy of the registry keys from a managed deployment script using the following command:
  
    `regedit /e Secdrv_configuration_backup.reg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Secdrv`
  
    2. Save the following to a file with a .REG extension (e.g. Disable\_Secdrv.reg):
  
    ```
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Secdrv]
    "Start"=dword:00000004
    ```
  
    3. Run the registry script created in Step 2 on the target machine with the following command:
  
    `Regedit /s Disable_Secdrv.reg`
  
    4. Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Accessories**, and click **Command Prompt.**
  
    5. Run the following command at a command prompt:
  
    `sc stop secdrv`
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Programs that require this driver will not run.
