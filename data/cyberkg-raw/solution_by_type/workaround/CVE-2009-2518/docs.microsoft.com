Workarounds for GDI+ WMF Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2500
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Disable metafile processing

Click Start, click Run, type Regedit, and then click OK.

Locate and then click the following registry subkey:


HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\GRE_Initialize

On the Edit menu, select New, and then click DWORD.

Type DisableMetaFiles, and then press ENTER.

On the Edit menu, click Modify to modify the DisableMetaFiles registry entry.

In the Value data box, type 1, and then click OK.

Exit Registry Editor.

Reboot the computer.


Impact of workaround. Metafile processing will stop working.
How to undo the workaround.

Click Start, click Run, type Regedit, and then click OK.

Locate and then click the following registry subkey:


HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\GRE_Initialize

On the Edit menu, click Modify on the DisableMetaFiles registry entry.

In the Value data box, type 0, and then click OK.

Exit Registry Editor.

Reboot the computer.



Disable metafile processing through GPO

Save the following to a file with a .REG extension (e.g. Disable_MetaFiles.reg):

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\GRE_Initialize]
"DisableMetaFiles"=dword:00000001

Run the above registry script on the target machine with the following command from an administrator command prompt:

Regedit.exe /s Disable_MetaFiles.reg

Reboot the computer.

Impact of workaround. Metafile processing will stop working.

Restrict access to gdiplus.dll

Run the following commands from an elevated administrator command prompt

Prevent RSClientPrint from running in Internet Explorer
You can disable attempts to instantiate RSClientPrint in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797. Follow these steps in this article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent RSClientPrint from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.
Paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.

Read e-mails in plain text
To help protect yourself from the e-mail attack vector, read e-mail messages in plain text format.
Microsoft Office Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Office Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.
Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594.
For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387.
Impact of workaround. E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

To help protect yourself from the e-mail attack vector, read e-mail messages in plain text format.
Microsoft Office Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Office Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.
Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594.
For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387.
Impact of workaround. E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.



Workarounds for GDI+ TIFF Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2503

Disable XAML Browser Applications in Internet Explorer
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running XAML Browser Applications or to disable XAML Browser Applications altogether in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the Tools menu.

Click the Security tab.

Click Internet, and then click Custom Level.

Under Settings, in the .NET Framework section, under XAML browser applications, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.

Click Local intranet, and then click Custom Level.

Under Settings, in the .NET Framework section, under XAML browser applications, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.

If you are prompted to confirm that you want to change these settings, click Yes.

Click OK to return to Internet Explorer.


Impact of workaround. XBAP applications will not run or will not run without a prompt.
Note Disabling XAML Browser Applications in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.
How to undo the workaround.

In Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the Tools menu.

Click the Security tab.

Click Internet, and then click Custom Level.

Under Settings, in the .NET Framework section, under XAML browser applications, click Enable, and then click OK.

Click Local intranet, and then click Custom Level.

Under Settings, in the .NET Framework section, under XAML browser applications, click Enable, and then click OK.

If you are prompted to confirm that you want to change these settings, click Yes.

Click OK to return to Internet Explorer.



Disable partially trusted .NET applications
By preventing all .NET applications without full trust from running, this vulnerability is effectively shielded as .NET applications with full trust can already make any change to the system. To disable all .NET applications running at partial trust, run the following commands from an elevated administrator command prompt:
caspol -pp offcaspol -m -resetlockdowncaspol -pp on
Impact of workaround. Some .NET applications will not run.

This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

Read e-mails in plain text
To help protect yourself from the e-mail attack vector, read e-mail messages in plain text format.
Microsoft Office Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Office Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.
Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594.
For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387.

The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
