#### Workarounds for Microsoft Malformed EPS Filter Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3019
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Modify the Access Control List to deny access to EPSIMP32.FLT for all users**
  
    **Registry Method**
    
    **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **regedit.exe**, and then click **OK**.  
    2.  Navigate to **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Shared Tools\\Graphics Filters\\Import\\EPS**  
    3.  Take note of the value of **Path**. In explorer, navigate to the **EPSIMP32.FLT** file at the location listed as the value of **Path**.  
    4.  Right click on **EPSIMP32.FLT** file and select **Properties**.  
    5.  On the **Security** tab, click **Advanced**.  
    6.  Uncheck **Allow inheritable permissions from the parent to propagate to this object…** and click **Remove**.  
    7.  Click **OK**, **Yes**, and **OK**.
  
    **Script Method**
  
    **For all supported 32-bit editions of Windows XP**  
    Run the following command from a command prompt:  
    cacls "%ProgramFiles%\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\GRPHFLT\\EPSIMP32.FLT" /E /P everyone:N
  
    **For all supported x64-based editions of Windows XP**  
    Run the following command from a command prompt:  
    cacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\GRPHFLT\\EPSIMP32.FLT" /E /P everyone:N
  
    **For all supported 32-bit editions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008**  
    Run the following commands from a command prompt as an administrator:  
    takeown /f "%ProgramFiles%\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\GRPHFLT\\EPSIMP32.FLT"  
    icacls "%ProgramFiles%\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\GRPHFLT\\EPSIMP32.FLT" /save %TEMP%\\ EPSIMP32 \_ACL.TXT  
    icacls "%ProgramFiles%\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\GRPHFLT\\EPSIMP32.FLT" /deny everyone:(F)
  
    **For all supported x64-based editions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008**  
    Run the following commands from a command prompt as an administrator:  
    takeown /f "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\GRPHFLT\\EPSIMP32.FLT"  
    icacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\GRPHFLT\\EPSIMP32.FLT" /save %TEMP%\\ EPSIMP32 \_ACL.TXT  
    icacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\GRPHFLT\\EPSIMP32.FLT" /deny everyone:(F)
  
    **Impact of Workaround.** Office applications will not be able to import EPS images in Office documents.
  
    **How to undo the workaround:**
  
    **For all supported 32-bit editions of Windows XP**  
    Run the following command from a command prompt:  
    cacls "%ProgramFiles%\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\GRPHFLT\\EPSIMP32.FLT" /E /R everyone
  
    **For all supported x64-based editions of Windows XP**
