Workarounds for LDAPS Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2011-2014
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Removethe useraccountfrom the domain that was subject to the revokedcertificate.

Use IPsec-based connections in "Always check CRL" mode, in addition to using LDAPS.
For information on how to enable CRL checking with IPsec, see the TechNet article, Certificate revocation list (CRL) verification - an application choice.
Notes

Use IPsec to encrypt and protect the connection to LDAPS using certificate authentication with CRL checking.

Use IPsec to protect the connection to LDAPS using certificate authentication with CRL checking and no encryption. In this case, LDAPS handles the encryption.
For affected editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, AuthIP (the IPsec extension that allows user-authentication) can be employed to prevent an attacker from performing IPsec certificate authentication using a machine certificate and then using the revoked user certificate to perform LDAPS authentication.

Use NULL encapsulation for LDAPS to prevent encrypting twice and be aware that certificate authentication on the IPsec level is independent of the authentication happening in SSL. This means that using separate certificates at each layer can still allow access to LDAPS via the expired certificate.
