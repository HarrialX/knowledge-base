Workarounds for Floating Point Techno-color Time Bandit RCE Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0655
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Set Office File Validation to disable editing in protected view in PowerPoint 2010
Note  See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2501584 to use the automated Microsoft Fix it solution, "Disable Edit in Protected View for PowerPoint 2010," to enable or disable this workaround.
Warning  Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
To manually apply this workaround:

Open Registry Editor and navigate to the following registry key:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileValidation
Set the value for DisableEditFromPV to "00000001"
Exit Registry Editor

Impact of workaround.  Office File Validation will no longer allow the editing of suspicious files in PowerPoint 2010.
How to undo the workaround.

Open Registry Editor and navigate to the following registry key:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileValidation
Set the value for DisableEditFromPV to "00000000"
Exit Registry Editor


Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents in Microsoft PowerPoint from unknown or untrusted sources and locations
The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.
Note  Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.
For Office 2007
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileOpenBlock]
"BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001
Note  In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2007, all of the latest security updates for Office 2007 must be applied.
Impact of workaround. For Microsoft Office 2007, users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special exempt directory or have not moved files to a trusted location as discussed in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848 will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions.

Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources
The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) helps protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.
To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or Office 2007 installed.
To install MOICE, you must also have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the Microsoft Download Center.
MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit Microsoft Update to install all recommended updates.


Enable MOICE
Note See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865 to use the automated Microsoft Fix it solution to enable or disable this workaround.
To manually enable MOICE, run the commands as specified in the following table. Running the commands will associate the Office application extensions with MOICE.




Command to enable MOICE to be the registered handler




For Word, run the following command from a command prompt:
ASSOC .doc=oice.word.document


For Excel, run the following commands from a command prompt:
ASSOC .XLS=oice.excel.sheet
ASSOC .XLT=oice.excel.template
ASSOC .XLA=oice.excel.addin


For PowerPoint, run the following commands from a command prompt:
ASSOC .PPT=oice.powerpoint.show
ASSOC .POT=oice.powerpoint.template
ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow



Note On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, run the above commands from an elevated command prompt.
For more information on MOICE, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865.
Impact of workaround. Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the Microsoft Office 2007 Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.
How to undo the workaround. Run the commands to disable MOICE as specified in the table below.



Command to disable MOICE as the registered handler




For Word, run the following command from a command prompt:
