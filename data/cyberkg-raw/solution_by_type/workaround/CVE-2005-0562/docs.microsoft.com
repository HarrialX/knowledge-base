Workarounds for MSN Messenger Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0562:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Review all of the contacts currently in your contact list and remove or block any that you do not know, do not trust or no longer need.

Do not agree to accept file transfers from contacts you do not know or trust.

Block access to MSN Messenger and Web Messenger in a corporate environment.

Block access to outgoing port 1863 in your corporate environment. Note MSN Messenger Service is connected through port 1863 when a direct connection is established. When a direct connection cannot be established, the MSN Messenger Service is connected through port 80.

Block HTTP access to gateway.messenger.hotmail.com. If you would like to block access to MSN Web Messenger you will also need to block HTTP access to webmessenger.msn.com.
Impact of Workaround: MSN Messenger clients will not be able to connect to the MSN Messenger network
