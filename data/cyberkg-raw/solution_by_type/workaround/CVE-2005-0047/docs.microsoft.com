Workarounds for COM Structured Storage Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0047:
We have not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.
Workarounds for Input Validation Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0044:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Do not open or save documents that you receive from untrusted sources.
This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a document that contains a malicious OLE object. Open documents that are sent only from trusted sources.

Block MS-TNEF to help protect against attempts to exploit this vulnerability through SMTP e-mail.
Systems can be configured to block certain types of files sent through e-mail. Microsoft TNEF encoded e-mails, commonly known as Rich Text Formatted e-mail, can contain malicious OLE objects. These e-mails contain a file attachment that is usually named Winmail.dat to store the TNEF information. Blocking this file and blocking the application/ms-tnef MIME type could help protect both Exchange Servers and other affected programs from attempts to exploit this vulnerability if customers are unable to install the available security update. There are Exchange Server configuration settings, such as setting 'Exchange rich-text format' to 'Never used' or editing the registry and disabling TNEF processing that do not mitigate this vulnerability. To help protect an Exchange Server computer from attacks through SMTP, block the Winmail.dat file and all application/ms-tnef MIME type content before it reaches the Exchange Server computer. Note Exchange supports other messaging protocols such as X.400 that would not be protected using these workarounds. We recommend requiring authentication on all other client and message transport protocols to help prevent attacks using these protocols.
Note Filtering only for attachments with the filename Winmail.dat may not sufficient protect your system. A malicious file attachment could be given another filename that could then be processed by the Exchange Server computer. To help protecte against these types of e-mails, you must also block all application/ms-tnef MIME type content.
While there are many ways to block the Winmail.dat file and other TNEF content, here are some suggestions:

ISA Server 2000 SMTP Message Screener could be used to block all file attachments or just the Winmail.dat file. Blocking all file attachments is the recommendation to provide the most protection for this issue using ISA Server 2000 because ISA Server 2000 does not support blocking content based on MIME content types. See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 31532 for more information.
ISA Server 2000 SMTP Filter could be used to block all file attachments or just the Winmail.dat file. Blocking all file attachments is the recommendation to provide the most protection for this issue using ISA Server 2000 because ISA Server 2000 does not support blocking content based on MIME content types. See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 320703 for more information.
ISA Server 2004 SMTP Filter and Message Screener could be used to block all file attachments or just the Winmail.dat file. Blocking all file attachments is the recommendation to provide the most protection for this issue using ISA Server 2004 because ISA Server 2004 does not support blocking content based on MIME content types. See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 888709 for more information.
Use third party e-mail filters to block the all application/ms-tnef MIME content type before it is sent to the Exchange Server or vulnerable application.

Impact of workaround: Blocking TNEF attachments will result in the loss of Rich Text Formatted e-mail. In some cases, users could receive blank e-mails instead of the original content or not receive the e-mail at all. Blocking the TNEF attachments will not affect HTML encoded or plain text e-mail messages. This procedure should only be performed if you are unable to install the available security update or a security update is not publicly available for your configuration.

Require authentication for connections to Exchange for all client and message transport protocols.
Requiring authentication for all connections made to the Exchange Server computer will help protect against anonymous attacks. This will not protect against an attack from a malicious user who can successfully authenticate.
Impact of workaround: Anonymous communication from clients through IMAP, POP3, HTTP, LDAP, SMTP and NNTP will no longer be possible. Server to server anonymous communication through RPC, X.400, foreign gateway, and third-party connector protocols will also no longer be possible. In most Exchange server configurations, authenticated access is already required for all protocols except SMTP. If all application/ms-tnef MIME type message parts and the Winmail.dat file can be blocked, as describe in the previous workaround, anonymous SMTP connections could still be accepted.

Do not accept incoming public newsfeeds through the NNTP protocol.
Incoming newsfeeds are not enabled by default for Exchange Server. If you have subscribed to incoming newsfeeds from public newsgroups, an attacker could post a malicious message to such a newsgroup. Even if you require authentication between the news server and your Exchange Server computer, such a message could still be transferred to your Exchange Server computer. Therefore, you should disable incoming newsfeeds from any NNTP server that could let a user post a malicious message.
Impact of workaround: Exchange access to public newsgroup feeds will no longer be possible.

Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or a later version, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or a later version, to help protect yourself from the e-mail attack vector.
Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.
Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594.
For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387.
Impact of Workaround: E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.
