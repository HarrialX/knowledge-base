Instructions:
To work around this vulnerability, administrators can set a maximum hold queue value that is greater than 250 for all device interfaces. The following example shows how to set the value to 350 by using the hold queue in interface configuration command:

Router# configure terminal
Router(config)# interface gigabitEthernet 1
Router(config-if)# hold-queue 350 in

Administrators can also configure an access-control list (ACL) that blocks UDP packets with a destination port of 0 and apply the ACL to all device interfaces, for example:

Extended IP access list 180
    10 deny udp any any eq 0
