Workarounds for Outlook Express News Reading Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1213:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. These workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability. However, they help block known attack vectors. Workarounds may reduce functionality in some cases; in such cases, the reduction in functionality is identified below.

Block Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)traffic on ports 119 TCP and 119 UDP. Only allow connections to trusted newsgroup servers through your firewall.
Block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems. Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190 and Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878.
Do not connect to untrusted newsgroup servers.
