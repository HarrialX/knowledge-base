| **/n:v**    | No version checking - Install the program over any earlier version.                                                 |
  
**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).
  
**Removing the Update**
  
To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. **Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the Microsoft Office XP CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).
  
**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
  
-   **File Version Verification**
  
    Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.  
    2.  In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.  
    3.  In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.  
    4.  In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.  
        **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.  
    5.  On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.  
        **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 3.1 or later be installed on the system.
  
To install the 3.1 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:
  
-   [Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=5a58b56f-60b6-4412-95b9-54d056d6f9f4&displaylang=en)  
-   [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Microsoft Windows 2000](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang=en)
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
This security update supports the following setup switches.
  
| Switch                    | Description                                                                                                         |  
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **/?** or **/help**       | Displays usage dialog.                                                                                              |  
| **/passive**              | Specifies passive mode. Requires no user interaction; users see basic progress dialogs but cannot cancel.           |  
| **/quiet**                | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.                                        |  
| **/norestart**            | Suppresses restarting the system if the update requires a restart.                                                  |  
| **/forcerestart**         | Automatically restarts the system after applying the update, regardless of whether the update requires the restart. |  
| **/extract**              | Extracts the files without installing them. You are prompted for a target folder.                                   |  
| **/extract:<path>** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |  
| **/lang:<LCID>**    | Forces the use of a specific language, when the update package supports that language.                              |  
| **/log:<log file>** | Enables logging, by both Vnox and Installer, during the update installation.                                        |
  
**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).
  
**Removing the Update**
  
To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.
  
**Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the 2007 Microsoft Office CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).
  
**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
  
-   **File Version Verification**
  
    Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search** box.  
    2.  When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.  
    3.  On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.  
    4.  You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.  
    5.  Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
