Workarounds for Telephony Service Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0058:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Disable the Telephony service.
Disabling the Telephony service will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To disable the Telephony service, follow these steps:

Click Start, and then click Control Panel. Alternatively, Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

Double-click Administrative Tools.

Double-click Services.

Double-click Telephony.

In the Startup type list, click Disabled.

Click Stop, and then click OK.
You can also stop and disable the Telephony service by using the following command at the command prompt:


sc stop tapisrv & sc config tapisrv start= disabled


Impact of Workaround: If the Telephony service is disabled, any dependant services or operating system features would fail. Examples of these features include the new connection wizard, RAS, modem based dial-up networking, and the fax service, would fail. Therefore, we recommend this workaround only on systems that cannot apply the security update.

Block the following at the firewall:

UDP ports 135, 137, 138, and 445, and TCP ports 135, 139, 445, and 593
All unsolicited inbound traffic on ports greater than 1024
Any other specifically configured RPC port

These ports are used to initiate a connection with RPC. RPC can be used to remotely communicate with the Telephony service on Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server 2003. Blocking them at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Also, make sure that you block any other specifically configured RPC port on the remote system. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports that RPC uses, visit the following Web site.

To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, such as the Internet Connection Firewall, which is included with Windows Server 2003.
By default, the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows Server 2003 helps protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. We recommend that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet.


To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:
1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
2.  In the default Category View, click **Network and Internet Connections**, and then click **Setup or change your home or small office network**. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your system is connected directly to the Internet.  

To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection, follow these steps:

Click Start, and then click Control Panel.
In the default Category View, click Networking and Internet Connections, and then click Network Connections.
Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click Properties.
Click the Advanced tab.
Click to select the Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet check box, and then click OK.
Note If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, click Settings on the Advanced tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services that are required.


To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature.
You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 309798.

To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, block the affected ports by using IPsec on the affected systems.
Use Internet Protocol security (IPsec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPsec and about how to apply filters is available in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190 and Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878.
