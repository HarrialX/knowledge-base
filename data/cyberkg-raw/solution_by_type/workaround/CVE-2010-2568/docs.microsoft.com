#### Workarounds for Shortcut Icon Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2568
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Disable the displaying of icons for shortcuts**
  
    **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2286198](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2286198) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround. This Fix it solution requires a restart upon completion in order to be effective. This Fix it solution deploys the workaround, and thus has the same user impact. We recommend that administrators review the KB article closely prior to deploying this Fix it solution.
  
    **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.  
    2.  Locate and then select the following registry key:  
        HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\\lnkfile\\shellex\\IconHandler  
    3.  Click the **File** menu and then click **Export**.  
    4.  In the **Export Registry File** dialog box, enter **LNK\_Icon\_Backup.reg** and then click **Save**.  
        **Note** This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default.  
    5.  Select the value **(Default)** on the right pane in the Registry Editor. Press **Enter** to edit the value of the key. Delete the value, so that the value is blank, and press **Enter**.  
    6.  Locate and then select the following registry key:  
        HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\\piffile\\shellex\\IconHandler  
    7.  Click the **File** menu and then click **Export**.  
    8.  In the **Export Registry File** dialog box, enter **PIF\_Icon\_Backup.reg** and then click **Save**.  
        **Note** This creates a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default.  
    9.  Select the value **(Default)** on the right pane in the Registry Editor. Press **Enter** to edit the value of the key. Delete the value, so that the value is blank, and press **Enter**.  
    10. Log all users off and on again, or restart the computer.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Disabling icons from being displayed for shortcuts prevents the issue from being exploited on affected systems. When this workaround is implemented, the system may display most icons as a "white" default object icon, which does impact usability. We recommend that system administrators test this workaround thoroughly prior to deployment. When the workaround is undone, all icons will reappear.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    Using the interactive method
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.  
    2.  Click the **File** menu and then click **Import**.  
    3.  In the **Import Registry File** dialog box, select **LNK\_Icon\_Backup.reg**, and then click **Open**.  
    4.  Click the **File** menu and then click **Import**.  
    5.  In the **Import Registry File** dialog box, select **PIF\_Icon\_Backup.reg**, and then click **Open**.  
    6.  Exit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.
  
    Manually resetting the Registry key values to the default values
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.  
    2.  Locate and then click the following registry key:  
        HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\\lnkfile\\shellex\\IconHandler  
    3.  Reset the registry key value to:  
        **{00021401-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}**  
    4.  Locate and then click the following registry key:  
        HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\\piffile\\shellex\\IconHandler  
    5.  Reset the registry key value to:  
        **{00021401-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}**  
    6.  Restart the computer
  
-   **Disable the WebClient service**
  
    Disabling the WebClient service helps protect affected systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability by blocking the most likely remote attack vector through the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service. After applying this workaround it is still possible for remote attackers who successfully exploit this vulnerability to cause Microsoft Office Outlook to run programs located on the targeted user's computer or the Local Area Network (LAN), but users will be prompted for confirmation before opening arbitrary programs from the Internet.
  
    To disable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.  
    2.  Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.  
    3.  Change the Startup type to **Disabled**. If the service is running, click **Stop**.  
    4.  Click **OK** and exit the management application.
  
    **Impact of workaround.**Â When the WebClient service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. In addition, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. For example, WebDAV shares will be inaccessible from the client computer.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    To re-enable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.  
    2.  Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.  
    3.  Change the Startup type to **Automatic**. If the service is not running, click **Start**.  
    4.  Click **OK** and exit the management application.
  
-   **Block the download of LNK and PIF files from the Internet**
  
    Blocking the download of LNK and PIF files on the Internet Gateway provides protection against remote exploitation of these attacks. Note that the files can be transferred over WebDAV, so any blocking solution should take this protocol into account.
  
-   **Block outbound SMB connections on the perimeter firewall**  
    Blocking outbound SMB connections on the perimeter firewall reduces the risk of remote exploitation using file shares.
