#### Workarounds for Radius OTP Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1135
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   Disable fallback to Basic authentication for ISA Forms-Based authentication together with Radius OTP
  
    1.  For customers running the original release version of Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration Server 2006, install the hotfix available from [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 938966](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/938966/). Customers running Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration Server 2006 Supportability Update and Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration Server 2006 Service Pack 1 do not need to apply the hotfix.  
    2.  Run the Microsoft Visual Basic script available from the **Post-hotfix installation information** section of [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 938966](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/938966/), according to the instructions in the article.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** ISA server will not allow basic authentication from clients served by that Web Listener.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    1.  Edit the Microsoft Visual Basic script available from the **Post-hotfix installation information** section of [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 938966](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/938966/) to revise "Const SE\_VPS\_VALUE = true" to "Const SE\_VPS\_VALUE = false."  
    2.  Save the script, and then run it.
