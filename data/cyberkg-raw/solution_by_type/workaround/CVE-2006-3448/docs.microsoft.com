Workarounds for Interactive Training Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3448:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Disable the handler for Step-by-Step Interactive Training bookmark link files by removing the related registry keys.
Delete these keys to help reduce attacks. This workaround helps reduce attacks by preventing Step-by-Step Interactive Training from automatically opening the affected file types. The content can still be opened from within the Step-by-Step Interactive Training user interface.
Important This bulletin contains information about how to modify the registry. Make sure to back up the registry before you modify it. Make sure that you know how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up, restore, and modify the registry, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 256986.
Warning Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly by using Registry Editor or by using another method. These problems might require that you reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that these problems can be solved. Modify the registry at your own risk.

Click Start, click Run, type regedt32, and then click OK.

In Registry Editor, locate the following registry:
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.cbl (for “Microsoft Press Interactive Training”)HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.cbm (for “Interactive Training”)HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.cbo (for “Microsoft Interactive Training ”)

For each subkey that is found, click the subkey, and then click DELETE.

In the Confirm Key Delete dialog box, click OK.


These actions can also be performed at a command prompt by using the following commands in the following order:
reg.exe export HKCR\.cbl c:\cbl.regreg.exe delete HKCR\.cbl /freg.exe export HKCR\.cbm c:\cbm.regreg.exe delete HKCR\.cbm /freg.exe export HKCR\.cbo c:\cbo.regreg.exe delete HKCR\.cbo /f
Impact of Workaround: Step-by-Step Interactive Training bookmark files can no longer be opened. The content can still be opened from within the Step-by-Step Interactive Training user interface.

Do not open or save Step-by-Step Interactive Training bookmark link files (.cbo, .cbl, .cbm) that you receive from untrusted sources.
This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a .cbo, .cbl, or .cbm file. Do not open files that use these file name extensions. This workaround does not cover other vectors of attack such as Web browsing.

Remove Step-by-Step Interactive Training by using the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.
To manually remove Step-by-Step Interactive Training from a system, follow these steps.

Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
Double-click Add or Remove Programs.
In the Add or Remove Programs dialog box, click the name of the affected program and then click Remove.

Note Affected versions are "Microsoft Press Interactive Training" and "Interactive Training." However, removing these programs may not be a complete workaround, because "Microsoft Interactive Training" does not create an Add or Remove Programs entry. "Microsoft Interactive Training" is based on the Orun32.exe file. Therefore, you must also manually verify that the Orun32.exe file is not present on your system.

Follow the instructions to complete the removal.
