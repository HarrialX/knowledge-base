Workarounds for showHelp Vulnerability - CAN-2003-1041:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

Strengthen the security settings for the Local Machine zone in Internet Explorer
Because this vulnerability permits an attacker to run HTML code in the Local Machine security zone, users can reduce the impact of this vulnerability by restricting the default settings in this zone. For more information about these settings, and for more information about the potential impacts of changing these default settings, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 833633.
Warning: Microsoft recommends that customers consider these changes to Internet Explorer security settings as a last resort only. If you make these changes, you may lose some functionality for some Windows programs and components. Before you make these changes in a production environment, test the changes extensively to verify that mission-critical programs continue to work correctly for all users.

Unregister HTML Help
To unregister the HTML Help protocol, follow these steps:

Click Start, click Run, type "regsvr32 /u %windir%\system32\itss.dll" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.
Note On Windows 98 and Windows Me, replace "system32" with "system" in this command.

A dialog box appears to confirm that the unregistration process has succeeded. Click OK to close the dialog box.
Impact of Workaround: All HTML Help functionality will be unavailable. This will affect the online Help in Windows or any application that uses HTML Help functionality.



Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or later, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or later, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.
Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or later and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.
Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about enabling this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594.
For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387.
Impact of Workaround: E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. In addition:

The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.
