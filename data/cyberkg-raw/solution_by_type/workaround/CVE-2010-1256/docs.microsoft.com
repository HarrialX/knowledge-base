#### Workarounds for IIS Authentication Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1256
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Require Token Checking**
  
    Systems that have Internet Information Services configured to use Extended Protection to 'Require' token checking, as described in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 973917](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973917), do not expose this vulnerability.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** This configuration change will not allow clients that do not implement Extended Protection to authenticate.
