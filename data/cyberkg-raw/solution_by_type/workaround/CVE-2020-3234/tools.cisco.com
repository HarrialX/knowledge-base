Instructions:
There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability in Cisco IOS Software releases 15.6(3)M and later.
These releases introduced the global configuration command iox hypervisor password <strong_password> to allow administrators to replace the default password that is used to log in to VDS. An administrator can use this command to define a strong password to replace the default password that provides VDS access on an affected device, as shown in the following example:

Router#configure terminal
router(config)#iox hypervisor password 
Router(config)#end
Router#

This action may be a suitable workaround until switches that are affected by this vulnerability can be upgraded.
