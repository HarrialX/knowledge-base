#### Workarounds for Pointer Dereference Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0566
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality.
  
-   **Disable the Publisher Converter DLL**
  
    For Windows XP, run the following command from a command prompt:
  
    `cacls “c:\program files\microsoft office\office12\pubconv.dll” /E /P everyone:N`
  
    For 64-bit editions of Windows XP, run the following command from a command prompt:
  
    `cacls <64BIT_PATH_AND_FILENAME> /E /P everyone:N`
  
    **Note** Use the Windows paths appropriate for your system, such as “%ProgramFiles(86)%” or “%windir%\\SysWOW64”.
  
    For Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:
  
    `takeown /f “c:\program files\microsoft office\office12\pubconv.dll”icacls “c:\program files\microsoft office\office12\pubconv.dll” /save %TEMP%\ PUBCONV ACL.TXTicacls “c:\program files\microsoft office\office12\pubconv.dll” /deny everyone(F)`
  
    For 64-bit editions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:
  
    `takeown /f <64BIT_PATH_AND_FILENAME>icacls <64BIT_PATH_AND_FILENAME> /save %TEMP%\ FILENAME _ACL.TXTicacls <64BIT_PATH_AND_FILENAME> /deny everyone (F)`
  
    **Note** Use the Windows paths appropriate for your system, such as “%ProgramFiles(86)%” or “%windir%\\SysWOW64”.
  
**Impact of workaround.** Users who have disabled the Publisher Converter DLL will not be able to open Microsoft Office Publisher files created in versions earlier than Publisher 2007.
  
**How to undo the workaround:**
  
For Windows XP, run the following command from a command prompt:
  
`cacls “c:\program files\microsoft office\office12\pubconv.dll” /E /R everyone`
  
For 64-bit editions of Windows XP, run the following command from a command prompt:
  
`cacls <64BIT_PATH_AND_FILENAME> /E /R everyone`
  
**Note** Use the Windows paths appropriate for your system, such as “%ProgramFiles(86)%” or “%windir%\\SysWOW64”.
  
For Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, run the following command from an elevated command prompt:
  
`icacls “c:\program files\microsoft office\office12\” /restore %TEMP%\PUBCONV_ACL.TXT`
  
For 64-bit editions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, run the following command from an elevated command prompt:
  
`icacls <64BIT_PATH_ONLY> /restore %TEMP%\FILENAME_ACL.TXT`
  
**Note** Use the Windows paths appropriate for your system, such as “%ProgramFiles(86)%” or “%windir%\\SysWOW64”.
