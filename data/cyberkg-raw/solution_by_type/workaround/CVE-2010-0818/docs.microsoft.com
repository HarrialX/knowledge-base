#### Workarounds for MPEG-4 Codec Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0818
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Restrict access to the MPEG-4 version 1 codec**
  
    To restrict access to the MPEG-4 version 1 codec, perform the following steps:
  
    **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
  
    1.  Create a backup copy of the registry keys by using a managed deployment script that contains the following commands:  
        `Regedit.exe /e MPEG-4_Backup1.reg "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{82CCD3E0-F71A-11D0-9FE5-00609778EA66}"`  
    `Regedit.exe /e MPEG-4_Backup2.reg "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{2a11bae2-fe6e-4249-864b-9e9ed6e8dbc2}"`  
    **Note** Depending on what versions of the MPEG-4 codec are installed on your system, some of the registry keys above might not exist. No backup file will be created for the registry keys that do not exist on the system.  
2.  Save the following to a file with a .REG extension, such as Restrict\_MPEG-4\_Workaround.reg:  
    `Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 `  

    `[-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{82CCD3E0-F71A-11D0-9FE5-00609778EA66}]`  

    `[-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{2a11bae2-fe6e-4249-864b-9e9ed6e8dbc2}]`  
3.  Run the above registry script on the target machine with the following command from an elevated command prompt:  
    `Regedit.exe /s Restrict_MPEG-4_Workaround.reg `

**Impact of workaround.** Files encoded in MPEG-4 version 1 format will not play in applications, such as Windows Media Player, that use the MPEG-4 codec.

**How to undo the workaround.**  

Restore the original state by running the following commands:  
`Regedit.exe /s MPEG-4_Backup1.reg Regedit.exe /s MPEG-4_Backup2.reg`

**Note** Some of the registry backup files above might not exist. No backup file was created for the registry keys that did not exist on the system prior to implementing this workaround.
