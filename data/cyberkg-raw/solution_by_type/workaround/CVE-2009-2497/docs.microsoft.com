Workarounds for Microsoft .NET Framework Pointer Verification Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0090
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Disable partially trusted Microsoft .NET applications
To disable all Microsoft .NET applications running at partial trust, including XAML browser applications (XBAPs) and Microsoft .NET applications located on the network, run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:
caspol –pp offcaspol –m –resetlockdowncaspol –pp on
Note You must be logged in as administrator or have administrative credentials to complete this workaround.
Impact of workaround. Some Microsoft .NET applications will not run.
How to undo the workaround.
To reset the Microsoft .NET security policies to the defaults, run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:
caspol –pp offcaspol –m –resetcaspol –pp on
Note You must be logged in as administrator or have administrative credentials to undo this workaround.

Disable XAML browser applications in Internet Explorer
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running XAML browser applications (XBAPs) or to disable XBAPs in the Internet and Local intranet security zones.

Tools menu and then select Internet Options.
Security tab, click Internet, and then click Custom level.
Settings, for Loose XAML, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK. Repeat these steps for XAML browser applications and XPS documents.
Security tab, click Custom level, under .NET Framework-reliant components, for Run components not signed with Authenticode, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK. Repeat these steps for Run components signed with Authenticode, and then click OK.
Local intranet, and then click Custom Level. Repeat steps 3 and 4. If you are prompted to confirm that you want to change these settings, click Yes. Click OK to return to Internet Explorer.

Impact of workaround. Microsoft .NET code will not run in Internet Explorer or will not run without a prompt. Disabling Microsoft .NET applications and components in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.
How to undo the workaround.

Tools menu and then select Internet Options.
Security tab, click Reset all zones to default level, and then click OK.

Temporarily prevent the Microsoft Silverlight ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer on Windows XP Service Pack 2 or later
You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by temporarily preventing the Silverlight ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer. You can use the Internet Explorer Manage Add-ons feature to disable the ActiveX control.

Tools menu and then select Manage Add-ons.
Microsoft Silverlight.
Disable, and then click OK.

Note If you cannot locate the ActiveX control, use the drop-down box to switch from "Add-ons currently being used in Internet Explorer" to "Add-ons that have been used by Internet Explorer", or from "Currently loaded add-ons" to "All add-ons", and then follow steps 2 and 3. If the ActiveX control is not present in this list you either have not used the ActiveX control before or it is not present on your system.
Note This workaround is intended only for systems on which Silverlight is already installed, and cannot be used proactively on systems where Silverlight is not yet installed.
For more information on the Internet Explorer Manage Add-ons feature in Windows XP Service Pack 2, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 883256.
Impact of workaround. Applications and Web sites that require the Microsoft Silverlight ActiveX control may no longer function correctly. If you implement this workaround it would affect any Silverlight ActiveX control you have installed on your system.
How to undo the workaround.

Tools menu and then select Manage Add-ons.
Microsoft Silverlight, click Enable, and then click OK.


Temporarily prevent the Microsoft Silverlight ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer
You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by temporarily preventing attempts to instantiate the Silverlight ActiveX control in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control.
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
We recommend that you back up the registry before you edit it.
Use the following text to create a .reg file that temporarily prevents attempts to instantiate the Silverlight ActiveX control in Internet Explorer. You can copy the following text, paste it into a text editor such as Notepad, and then save the file with the .reg file name extension. Run the .reg file on the vulnerable client.
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{DFEAF541-F3E1-4C24-ACAC-99C30715084A}]
Close Internet Explorer and reopen it for the changes to take effect.
For detailed steps about stopping a control from running in Internet Explorer, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797. Follow these steps and create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent the Silverlight ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer.
Impact of workaround. Applications and Web sites that require the Microsoft Silverlight ActiveX control may no longer function correctly. If you implement this workaround it would affect any Silverlight ActiveX control you have installed on your system.
How to undo the workaround. Remove the registry keys added to temporarily prevent attempts to instantiate the Silverlight ActiveX control in Internet Explorer.
