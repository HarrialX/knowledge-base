#### Workarounds for Local Security Authority Subsystem Service Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2524
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Uninstall KB968389 from Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 computers**
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Control Panel**, and then click **Add or Remove Programs**.  
    2.  Select **KB968389**, and then click **Uninstall**.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 computers will not benefit from Extended Protection for Authentication while this KB is disabled.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.** Install KB968389 by downloading the installation package appropriate to your operating system from [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 936389](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/968389?wa=wsignin1.0).
  
-   **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature**
  
    You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 309798](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309798).
  
-   **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, such as the Internet Connection Firewall**
  
    All supported editions of Windows Vista come with Windows Firewall, a two-way firewall that is automatically enabled.
  
    For all supported editions of Windows Server 2003, use the Internet Connection Firewall feature to help protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet.
  
    To enable the Windows Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, perform the following steps:
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.  
    2.  Double-click **Network Connections** and then click **Change Windows Firewall Settings**.  
    3.  On the **General** tab, ensure that the **On (recommended)** value is selected. This will enable the Windows Firewall.  
    4.  When the Windows Firewall is enabled, select **Donâ€™t allow exceptions** to prohibit all incoming traffic.
  
    For Windows Server 2003 systems, configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection using the following steps:
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.  
    2.  In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**.  
    3.  Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.    
    4.  Click the **Advanced** tab.  
    5.  Click to select the **Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet** check box, and then click **OK**.
  
    **Note** If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services that are required.
