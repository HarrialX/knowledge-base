#### Workarounds for Microsoft Color Management System Vulnerability - CVE-2008-2245
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Turn off metafile processing by modifying the registry**  
    Customers who have applied MS07-017 can disable metafile processing by modifying the registry. This setting will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.  
    To modify the key, follow these steps:
    
    **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.  
    2.  Locate and then click the following registry subkey:  
        HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\GRE\_Initialize  
    3.  On the **Edit** menu, point to **New**, and then click **DWORD**.  
    4.  Type **DisableMetaFiles**, and then press ENTER.  
    5.  On the **Edit** menu, click **Modify** to modify the DisableMetaFiles registry entry.  
    6.  In the **Value data** box, type **1**, and then click **OK**.  
    7.  Exit Registry Editor.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Turning off processing of metafiles may cause the appearance of software or system components to decrease in quality. Turning off processing of metafiles may also cause the software or system components to fail completely. It has been identified to have a potential significant functionality impact and should be evaluated and tested carefully to determine its applicability.
  
    Examples include the following:
  
-   You cannot print on the computer.
-   Some applications on the computer may be unable to display Clipart.
-   Some scenarios that involve OLE rendering may break. This most often occurs when the object server is not active.
  
    For more information on this setting read [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 941835](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/941835).
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.  
    2.  Locate and then click the following registry subkey:  
        HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\GRE\_Initialize  
    3.  Delete the "DisableMetaFiles" value
  
    You may have to restart your computer for this change to take effect.
  
-   **Read e-mail messages in plain text format to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector**
  
    You can help protect yourself against this vulnerability by changing your e-mail settings to read e-mail messages in plain text using Outlook 2002 and later, Outlook Express 6 and later, or Windows Mail. For information in Outlook, search “plain text” in Help and review “Read messages in plain text.” In Outlook Express, search “plain text” in Help and review “Reducing your risk of getting e-mail viruses.” In Windows Mail, search “plain text” in Help and review “Security and privacy in Windows Mail.”
  
    **Impact of workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:
  
    -   The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.  
    -   Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.  
    -   Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.
