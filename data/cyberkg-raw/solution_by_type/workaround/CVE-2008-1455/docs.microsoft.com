#### Workarounds for the Memory Allocation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0120
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

#### Workarounds for the Parsing Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1455
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or un-trusted sources**
  
    The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) will protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.
  
    To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or 2007 Office system installed.
  
    To install MOICE, you must have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the Microsoft Download Center:
  
    Download the FileFormatConverters.exe package now
  
    MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit Microsoft Update to install all recommended updates:

    To enable MOICE, change the registered handler for the .ppt, .pot, and .pps file formats. The following table describes the command to enable or to disable MOICE for the .ppt, .pot, and .pps file formats:
  
| Command to use to enable MOICE to be the registered handler | Command to use to disable MOICE as the registered handler |  
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|  
| ASSOC .PPT=oice.powerpoint.show                             | ASSOC .ppt=PowerPoint.Show.8                              |  
| ASSOC .POT=oice.powerpoint.template                         | ASSOC .pot=PowerPoint.Template.8                          |  
| ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow                        | ASSOC .pps=PowerPoint.SlideShow.8                         |
  
For more information on MOICE, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865).
  
**Impact of Workaround:** Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the 2007 Microsoft Office System Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.
  
-   **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations**
  
    The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.
    
    **Note** Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.
  
    -   **For Office 2003**
  
        Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  
        \[HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\11.0\\PowerPoint\\Security\\FileOpenBlock\]
  
        "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001
  
        **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Office 2003, all of the latest Office 2003 security updates must be applied.
  
        **Impact of Workaround:** Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special “exempt directory” as discussed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922848) will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions in Office 2003 or 2007 Microsoft Office System.
  
    -   **For 2007 Office system**
  
        Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  
        \[HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Office\\12.0\\PowerPoint\\Security\\FileOpenBlock\]
  
        "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001
  
        **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with the 2007 Microsoft Office system, all of the latest security updates for the 2007 Microsoft Office system must be applied.
  
        **Impact of Workaround:** Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special “exempt directory” as discussed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922848) will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions in Office 2003 or 2007 Microsoft Office System.
  
    **How to Undo the Workaround:**
  
    -   **For Office 2003**
  
        Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  
        \[HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\11.0\\PowerPoint\\Security\\FileOpenBlock\]
  
        "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000
  
    -   **For 2007 Office system**
  
        Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  
        \[HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Office\\12.0\\PowerPoint\\Security\\FileOpenBlock\]
  
        "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000
  
-   Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.
