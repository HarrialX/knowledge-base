#### Workarounds for IIS FTP Service Heap Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3972
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Stop and disable the FTP Service**
  
    Run the following command from a command prompt as an administrator:
  
    ```
    sc stop ftpsvc
    sc config ftpsvc start= disabled
    ```
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Clients will not be able to connect to the FTP server and upload or download files using the FTP Service.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    Run the following command from a command prompt as an administrator:
  
    ```
    sc config ftpsvc start= auto
    sc start ftpsvc
    ```
  
-   **Block FTP inbound traffic at the edge firewall**
  
    Block the following port at the firewall:  
    TCP Port 21
  
    This port is used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking this port at the edge firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
  
    **Impact of Workaround.** Applications and services may use the affected port. Blocking connectivity to the port may cause various applications or services to not function.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    Unblock TCP port 21 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
