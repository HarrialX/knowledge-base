Workarounds for ICMP Connection Reset Vulnerability - CVE-2004-0790:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Uninstall IPv6.
For the IPv6 protocol for Windows XP with SP2, Windows XP with SP1, or Windows Server 2003, do the following:

Log on to the computer with a user account that has privileges to change network configuration.
Click Start, click Control Panel, and then double-click Network Connections.
Click Microsoft TCP/IP version 6 (for Windows XP with SP2 or Windows Server 2003) or Microsoft IPv6 Developer Edition (for Windows XP with SP1), and then click Uninstall.
When prompted to confirm the removal of the Microsoft IPv6 Developer Edition or Microsoft TCP/IP version 6 protocol, click OK.

Alternately, from the Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 desktop do the following:

Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories.
Click Command Prompt.
At the command prompt, type netsh interface ipv6 uninstall.

Impact of Workaround: Uninstalling IPv6 would result in the system not being able to communicate with other hosts on an IPv6 configured network.

Block all ICMP network packets at the firewall or at the router:
ICMP network packets are used to initiate a connection with the affected components. Blocking them at the firewall or at the router will help protect systems that are behind that firewall or router from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet.
Impact of Workaround: This workaround can also negatively impact performance by preventing TCP from optimizing network communication. ICMP network packets can eliminate fragmentation at routers connecting networks with different MTUs. Fragmentation reduces TCP throughput and increases network congestion.
Note: Windows XP Service Pack 1 Firewall is unable to handle IPv6 network traffic. In order to ensure protection for your Windows XP Service Pack 1 system using the Internet Connection Firewall you should apply the update identified in KB Article 817778 “Overview of the Advanced Networking Pack for Windows XP”.

Block ICMP traffic by using IPSec on the affected systems.
Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190 and Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878.
Impact of Workaround: This workaround can also negatively impact performance by preventing TCP from optimizing network communication. ICMP network packets can eliminate fragmentation at routers connecting networks with different MTUs. Fragmentation reduces TCP throughput and increases network congestion.
