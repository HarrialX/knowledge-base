#### Workarounds for Windows Active Directory Remote Code Execution Vulnerability- CVE-2007-0040
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Block the following at the firewall:**    
    TCP port 389
  
    This port is used to initiate connection with the affected component. Blocking it at the enterprise firewall, both inbound and outbound, will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, visit [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
  
-   **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems.**    
    Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).
