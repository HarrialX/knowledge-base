Workarounds for WINS Service Failed Response Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1248
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Block TCP port 42 and UDP port 42 at your firewall.
These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking them at the enterprise firewall, both inbound and outbound, will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see TechNet article, TCP and UDP Port Assignments.
