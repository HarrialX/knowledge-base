Workarounds for Hyperlink COM Object Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3086:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. A workaround may not block all attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Modify the Access Control List to deny access to Hlink.dll for all users
Disabling the Hlink.dll registry key helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To modify the Hlink.dll registry key:

Click Start, click Run, type cacls "%windir%\system32\hlink.dll" /d everyone (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

Impact of Workaround: Users of Office applications will not be able to edit hyperlinks or click on hyperlinks embedded in Office documents.

Modify the Access Control List to disable the HLINK registry key
Modifying the Access Control List on the “HLINK” registry key helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To modify the registry key, follow these steps.
Note Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
Note We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.
For Windows 2000
Note Make a note of the permissions that are listed in the dialog box so that you can restore them to their original values at a later time

Click Start, click Run, type "regedt32" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.
Expand HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, expand CLSID, and then click {79eac9d0-baf9-11ce-8c82-00aa004ba90b}.
Click Security, and then click Permissions.
Click to clear the Allow Inheritable Permissions from the parent to propagate to this object check box. You are prompted to click Copy, Remove, or Cancel. Click Remove, and then click OK.
You receive a message that states that no one will be able to access this registry key. Click Yes when you are prompted to do so.

For Windows XP Service Pack 1 or later operating systems
Note Make a note of the permissions that are listed in the dialog box so that you can restore them to their original values at a later time

Click Start, click Run, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.
Expand HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, expand CLSID, and then click {79eac9d0-baf9-11ce-8c82-00aa004ba90b}.
Click Edit, and then click Permissions.
Click Advanced.
Click to clear the Inherit from parent the permission entries that apply to child objects. Include these with entries explicitly defined here. check box. You are prompted to click Copy, Remove, or Cancel. Click Remove, and then check OK.
You receive a message that states that no one will be able to access this registry key. Click Yes, and then click OK to close the Permissions for {79eac9d0-baf9-11ce-8c82-00aa004ba90b} dialog box.

Impact of Workaround: Users of Office applications will not be able to edit hyperlinks or click on hyperlinks embedded in Office documents.

Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or a later version, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or a later version, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.
Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.
For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387.
Impact of Workaround: E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.


Do not click on hyperlinks in Microsoft Office documents from untrusted sources.
