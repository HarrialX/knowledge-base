#### Workarounds for Remote Desktop Web Access Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1263
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Enable Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 XSS filter for Intranet Zone**
  
    1.  On the **Internet Explorer Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.  
    2.  In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Local Intranet** icon.  
    3.  Under **Security level for this zone**, click **Custom Level…**  
    4.  Scroll down to **Enable XSS Filter** (near end of list).  
    5.  Change the default **Disable** to **Enable**.  
    6.  Click **OK**, then click **Yes** on the **Are you sure you want to change the settings for this zone?** dialog.  
    7.  Click **OK** on the **Internet Options** dialog.
