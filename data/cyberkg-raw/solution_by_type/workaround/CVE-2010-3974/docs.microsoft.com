#### Workarounds for Fax Cover Page Editor Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3974
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Remove the Fax Cover Page .COV file association on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003**    
    If the .cov file type has been associated with the Windows Fax Cover Page Editor, removing the file association prevents the file from being automatically opened.
  
    **Note** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys and Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
  
    To remove the fax cover page (.cov) file association, perform the following steps:
  
    **Using the interactive method**
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **regedit**, and then click **OK.**  
    2.  Expand **HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT**, click on **.COV**, and then click the **File** menu and select **Export.**  
    3.  In the **Export Registry File** dialog box, type **Cover\_Page\_Backup.reg** and click **Save**.  
        **Note** This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default**.**  
    4.  Press the **Delete** key on the keyboard to delete the registry key. When prompted to delete the registry value, click **Yes.**
  
    **Using a managed deployment script**
  
    1.  Make a backup copy of the registry key using the following command:  
        `Regedit.exe /e cover_page_backup.reg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.COV`  
    2.  Save the following to a file with a .REG extension (e.g. Delete\_Cover\_Page\_Assoc.reg):  
        `Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00`  
        `[-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.COV]`  
    3.  Run the registry script created in the previous step with the following command:  
        `Regedit.exe /s delete_cover_page.reg`
  
    **Impact of workaround.** This workaround removes the .COV file association. Double-clicking a COV file will no longer launch Windows Fax Cover Page Editor.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    Using the interactive method
  
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK.**  
    2.  Click the **File** menu and select **Import.**  
    3.  In the Import Registry File dialog box, select **Cover\_Page\_Backup.reg** and click **Open.**
  
    Using a managed deployment script
  
    Restore the original state by running the following command:  
    `Regedit.exe /s cover_page_backup.reg`
