#### Workarounds for Reflected XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2012-2536
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Enable Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 XSS filter in the Local intranet security zone**
  
    You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to enable the XSS filter in the Local intranet security zone. (XSS filter is enabled by default in the Internet security zone.) To do this, perform the following steps:
  
    1.  In Internet Explorer 8 or Internet Explorer 9, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.  
    2.  Click the **Security** tab.  
    3.  Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom level**.  
    4.  Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Enable XSS filter**, click **Enable**, and then click **OK**.  
    5.  Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.
  
    **Impact of workaround**. Internal sites not previously flagged as being XSS risks could be flagged.
  
    **How to undo the workaround**.
  
    To undo this workaround, perform the following steps.
  
    1.  In Internet Explorer 8 or Internet Explorer 9, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.  
    2.  Click the **Security** tab.  
    3.  Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom level**.  
    4.  Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Enable XSS filter**, click **Disable**, and then click **OK**.  
    5.  Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.
