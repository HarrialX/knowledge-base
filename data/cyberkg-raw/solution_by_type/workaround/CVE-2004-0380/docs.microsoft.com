Workarounds for MHTML URL Processing Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0380:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

Strengthen the security settings for the Local Machine zone in Internet Explorer
Because this vulnerability permits an attacker to run HTML code in the Local Machine security zone, users can reduce the impact of this vulnerability by restricting the default settings in this zone. For more information about these settings, and for more information about the potential impacts of changing these default settings, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 833633.
Warning: Microsoft recommends that customers consider these changes to Internet Explorer security settings as a last resort only. If you make these changes, you may lose some functionality for some Windows programs and components. Before you make these changes in a production environment, test the changes extensively to verify that mission-critical programs continue to work correctly for all users.

Install Outlook E-mail Security Update if you are using Outlook 2000 SP1 or earlier.
By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been installed.
Customers who use one or more of these products could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability by having the user click a malicious link in the e-mail.

Read e-mail in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or later or if you are using Outlook Express 6 SP1 or later, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack method,
Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or later and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 can enable this setting and view all non-digitally signed e-mail messages or non-encrypted e-mail messages in plain text only.
Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about enabling this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594.
For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387.


Impact of Workaround
E-mail that is viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. In addition:

The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
Pictures become attachments to avoid loss.
Because the message is still in Rich Text format or in HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.
