Workarounds for Microsoft RichEdit Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1311:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Enable Embedded Object blocking in WordPad
Note: This workaround only applies to Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2, Microsoft Windows Server 2003, and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 systems.
Wordpad.exe is the default application used to open Rich Text files. Users can temporarily block the parsing of embedded objects within Rich Text Files.
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
We recommend that you back up the registry before you edit it.
Use the following text to create a .reg file that will automate editing of the registry to temporarily block the parsing of embedded objects with Rich Text Files when using Wordpad.exe. You can copy the following text, paste it into a text editor such as Notepad, and then save the file with the .reg file name extension. Run the .reg file on the vulnerable client.
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\RtfStreamIn\ObjectBlocking\wordpad.exe]
Impact of Workaround: Wordpad.exe will no longer parse embedded objects within Rich Text files.

Do not open or save RTF files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

Un-install WordPad from Windows 2000 or Windows 2003
Wordpad.exe is the default application used to open Rich Text files. By uninstalling WordPad, users can block the parsing of embedded objects within Rich Text Files.

Click Start, click Control Panel, and then click Add or Remove Programs.
Click Add/Remove Windows Components, double-click Accessories and Utilities, and then double-click Accessories.
Uncheck Wordpad, click Okay to let the Optional Component manager uninstall Wordpad.
