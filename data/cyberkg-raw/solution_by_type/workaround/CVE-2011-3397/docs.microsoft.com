Workarounds for Microsoft Time Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3397
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Disable time behavior in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Create a backup copy of the registry keys by performing the following commands from an elevated command prompt:
Regedit.exe /e Disable_datime_backup1.reg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{33FDA1EA-80DF-11d2-B263-00A0C90D6111}

Regedit.exe /e Disable_datime_backup2.reg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{476c391c-3e0d-11d2-b948-00c04fa32195}


Next, save the following to a file with a .REG extension, such as Disable_Time.reg:
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{33FDA1EA-80DF-11d2-B263-00A0C90D6111}]
[-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{476c391c-3e0d-11d2-b948-00c04fa32195}]


Run Disable_Time.reg with the following command from an elevated command prompt:
Regedit.exe /s Disable_Time.reg



Impact of workaround. Time behavior won't work.
How to undo the workaround. 
Restore the original state by performing the following commands from an elevated command prompt:
Regedit.exe /s Disable_datime_backup1.reg

Regedit.exe /s Disable_datime_backup2.reg


Prevent binary behaviors from being used in Internet Explorer
You can disable attempts to use a specific binary behavior in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the behavior in the registry.
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
To set the kill bit for a CLSIDs with a value of {33FDA1EA-80DF-11d2-B263-00A0C90D6111} and {476c391c-3e0d-11d2-b948-00c04fa32195}, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{33FDA1EA-80DF-11d2-B263-00A0C90D6111}]
"Compatibility Flags"=dword:04000400

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{33FDA1EA-80DF-11d2-B263-00A0C90D6111}]
"Compatibility Flags"=dword:04000400

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{476c391c-3e0d-11d2-b948-00c04fa32195}]
"Compatibility Flags"=dword:04000400

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{476c391c-3e0d-11d2-b948-00c04fa32195}]
"Compatibility Flags"=dword:04000400

You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, see the TechNet article, Group Policy collection.
Note You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.
Impact of Workaround. There is no impact as long as the behavior is not intended to be used in Internet Explorer.
How to undo the workaround. Delete the registry keys previously added in implementing this workaround.
