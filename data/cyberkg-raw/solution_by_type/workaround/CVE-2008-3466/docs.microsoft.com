#### Workarounds for HIS Command Execution Vulnerability - CVE- 2008-3466
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   For Host Integration Server 2004 and Host Integration Server 2006, do not configure the HIS/SNA service to run with an Administrator Account.
  
    -   When first installing Host Integration Server, administrators are prompted for an account to run the SNA RPC service with. Customers should follow best practices and select an account with non-administrative privileges.  
    -   The SNA service can be configured to use a lower privileged account through the Configuration Tool under the Host Integration Server folder in the Start menu.
    
    **Note** This workaround is not available for Host Integration Server 2000.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** None. Following best practices, the SNA service should be run with an account with non-administrative privileges.
  
-   For Host Integration Server 2000, Host Integration Server 2004 and Host Integration Server 2006, disable the SNA RPC Service.
  
    1.  To disable the affected service change the SnaRpcService service to disabled. This service is used to add performance counters and refresh the bindings when adding link services or additional SNA Server services to a server.  
    2.  Once these configuration tasks are completed, disable the SNA RPC service.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Normal runtime operation and additional configuration changes, such as adding connections, are not dependent on the SNA RPC service. However, if link services or nodes are added while this service is disabled, the associated performance counters will not be added and the SNA MngAgent service will need to be recycled for the configuration changes to be reflected in the SNA Manager. The collection of performance data is not impacted when the SNA RPC service is disabled.
