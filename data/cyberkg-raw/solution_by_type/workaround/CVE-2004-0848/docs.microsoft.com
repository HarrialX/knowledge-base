Workarounds for Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Microsoft Office XP - CAN-2004-0848:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

Enable prompting for office documents. By default, Internet Explorer will prompt the user to Open/Save As the document.
Note If this functionally has been turned off the documents will automatically be opened.
To re-enable this functionality, follow these steps:

Double-click on the My Computer icon on your desktop or in the start menu right-click My Computer and select Explore.
From the Tools menu, select Folder Options.
On the File Types tab, for each Office file type, highlight and click Advanced.
In the dialog box that is displayed, verify that the Confirm open after download setting is checked. Also, uncheck Browse in same window if it is checked.

Impact of Workaround:
Microsoft Office will now prompt the user to Open/Save As instead of allowing for malicious code to automatically be run.
