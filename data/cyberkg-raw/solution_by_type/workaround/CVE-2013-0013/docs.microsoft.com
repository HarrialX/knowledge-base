Workarounds for Microsoft SSL Version 3 and TLS Protocol Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2013-0013
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Configure Internet Explorer to disable SSLv2
You can help protect against attempts to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer by changing your settings to disable SSLv2. To do this, perform the following steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the Tools menu.
Click the Advanced tab.
Scroll down to the Security section.
Uncheck the box beside Use SSL 2.0.
Click OK to return to Internet Explorer.
