#### Workarounds for Windows Media Runtime Voice Sample Rate Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0555
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Unregister wmspdmod.dll**
  
    To unregister this DLL, run the following command from an elevated command prompt.
  
    For 32-bit Windows systems:
  
    `Regsvr32.exe –u %WINDIR%\system32\wmspdmod.dll`
  
    For x64-based Windows systems:
  
    `Regsvr32.exe –u %WINDIR%\syswow64\wmspdmod.dll`
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Audio streams in ASF files that use the Windows Media Speech Code will fail to play.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    Run the following command from an elevated command prompt.
  
    For 32-bit Windows systems:
  
    `Regsvr32.exe %WINDIR%\system32\wmspdmod.dll`
  
    For x64-based Windows systems:
  
    `Regsvr32.exe %WINDIR%\syswow64\wmspdmod.dll`
  
#### Workarounds for Windows Media Runtime Heap Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2525
  
-   **Deny access to msaud32.acm**
  
    On Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 systems:
  
    For 32-bit Windows systems:
  
    `Echo y| cacls %WINDIR%\system32\msaud32.acm /E /P everyone:N`
  
    For 64-bit Windows systems:
  
    `Echo y| cacls %WINDIR%\syswow64\msaud32.acm /E /P everyone:N`
  
    On Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008:
  
    Run the following commands from a command prompt as an administrator:
  
    For 32-bit Windows:
  
    `Takeown.exe /f "%windir%\system32\msaud32.acm"`  
    `Icacls.exe "%windir%\system32\msaud32.acm " /save %TEMP%\msaud32_acm.TXT`  
    `Icacls.exe "%windir%\system32\msaud32.acm " /deny everyone:(F)`
  
    For 64-bit Windows systems:
  
    `Takeown.exe /f "%windir%\syswow64\msaud32.acm"`  
    `Icacls.exe "%windir%\syswow64\msaud32.acm " /save %TEMP%\ msaud32_acm.TXT`  
    `Icacls.exe "%windir%\syswow64\msaud32.acm " /deny everyone:(F)`
  
    **Impact of workaround:** Applications that rely on the Audio Compression Manager (ACM) will fail to render content properly
  
    **How to undo the workaround:**
  
    On Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 systems:
  
    For 32-bit Windows systems:
  
    `cacls “%WINDIR%\system32\msaud32.acm” /E /R everyone`
  
    For 64-bit Windows systems:
  
    `cacls “%WINDIR%\syswow64\msaud32.acm” /E /R everyone`
  
    On Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008:
  
    Run the following commands from a command prompt as an administrator:
  
    For 32-bit Windows:
  
    `icacls %windir%\syswow64 /restore %TEMP%\msaud32_acm.TXT`
  
    For 64-bit Windows systems:
  
    `icacls %windir%\syswow64 /restore %TEMP%\msaud32_acm.TXT`
