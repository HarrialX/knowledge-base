Instructions:
The debugging and testing interface can be disabled by rebooting an affected device. In order to reboot an ESA device, issue the reboot command from the CLI. The interface will be permanently disabled and unavailable once the device has finished rebooting.

Customers concerned about the effectiveness of the workaround should open a support case with their support organization to verify the testing interface has effectively been disabled.
