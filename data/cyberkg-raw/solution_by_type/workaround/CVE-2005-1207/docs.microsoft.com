Workarounds for Web Client Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1207:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Disable the Web Client service
Disabling the Web Client service will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To disable the Web Client service, follow these steps:

Click Start, and then click Control Panel. Alternatively, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
Double-click Administrative Tools.
Double-click Services.
Double-click WebClient.
In the Startup type list, click Disabled.
Click Stop, and then click OK.
You can also stop and disable the Web Client service by using the following command at the command prompt:

sc stop WebClient & sc config WebClient start= disabled
Impact of Workaround: If the Web Client service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. If the Web Client service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. Windows Server 2003 users will not be able to use the "Open as Web Folder" functionality.

Use the Group Policy settings to disable the WebClient service on all affected systems that do not require this feature.
Because the Web Client service is a possible attack vector, disable the service by using the Group Policy settings. You can disable the startup of this service at either the local, site, domain, or organizational-unit level by using Group Policy object functionality in Windows 2000 domain environments or in Windows Server 2003 domain environments.
Note You may also review the Windows Server 2003 Security Guide. This guide includes information about how to disable services.
For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:

Impact of Workaround: If the Web Client service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. If the Web Client service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. Windows Server 2003 users will not be able to use the "Open as Web Folder" functionality.

Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall:
Although WebDAV uses TCP port 80 for outbound communication, TCP ports 139 and 445 can be used inbound to attempt to connect to this service and try to exploit this vulnerability. Blocking them at the firewall can help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, visit the following Web site.

To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, such as the Internet Connection Firewall, which is included with Windows XP and with Windows Server 2003.
By default, the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows XP and in Windows Server 2003 helps protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. We recommend that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet.
To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

Click Start, and then click Control Panel.

In the default Category View, click Network and Internet Connections, and then click Setup or change your home or small office network. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your system is connected directly to the Internet.
To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection, follow these steps:

Click Start, and then click Control Panel.

In the default Category View, click Networking and Internet Connections, and then click Network Connections.

Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click Properties.

Click the Advanced tab.

Click to select the Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet check box, and then click OK.


Note If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, click Settings on the Advanced tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services that are required.

To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature.
You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 309798.

To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems.
Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190 and Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878.
