Workarounds for Web View Script Injection Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1191:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Disable Web View:
Disabling Web View will reduce the ability to maliciously use this feature to perform an attack. To disable Web View, follow these steps:

Open My Computer
Under the Tools menu, select Folder Options.
On the General tab in the Web View section, select Use Windows classic folders
Click OK
These settings will only fully take affect after a user has logged off and then logged back onto the affected system.
Impact of Workaround: This change will reduce the functionality of Windows Explorer by removing the left hand task pane which contains links to common folders and tasks.


Use the Group Policy settings to disable Web View on all affected systems that do not require this feature.
Disabling Web View will reduce the ability to maliciously use this feature to perform an attack.
For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Web sites:

Impact of Workaround: This change will reduce the functionality of Windows Explorer by removing the left hand task pane which contains links to common folders and tasks.

Block Outbound TCP ports 139 and 445 at the perimeter firewall:
These ports are used to initiate a connection via the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. Blocking outbound SMB traffic at the perimeter firewall will help prevent systems from attempting to connect to a malicious file server outside of the firewall. For more information about the ports, visit the following web site.
Impact of Workaround: Machines behind the firewall will be unable to access trusted file servers via the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol outside of the network.
