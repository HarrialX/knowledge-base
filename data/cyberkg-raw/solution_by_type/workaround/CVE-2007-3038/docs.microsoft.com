#### Workarounds for Windows Vista Firewall Blocking Rule Information Disclosure Vulnerability – CVE-2007-3038
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Disable Teredo** 
  
    You can help protect against this vulnerability by disabling the Teredo transport mechanism. This prevents Teredo from being used as a transport or mechanism to traverse the NAT. To do this, run the following command as an administrator:
  
    **Netsh int ter set st disable** 
  
-   **Disable Teredo by modifying the registry.** 
  
    Teredo can also be disabled by modifying the Windows registry. Create the following registry value to disable Teredo as a transport mechanism.
  
    Note Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe
  
    1.  Start, click Run, type “regedit" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.  
    2.  Navigate to the following registry key: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\tcpip6\\Parameters\\  
    3.  Right click on the **DisabledComponents** key and select Modify.  
    4.  Set the value to **0x8** to disable Teredo.
  
    **Impact of Workaround:** If you disable Teredo, depending on network configuration, applications that use the Teredo interface will not function or be accessible.
  
-   **Block inbound and outbound Teredo UDP traffic using a Windows** **Vista** **Firewall setting.**  
    A custom firewall rule can be created that blocks all Teredo related traffic from communicating with the affected system. To do this, follow these steps:
  
    1.  Click **Control Panel** , click **Classic View.**  
    2.  Click **Administrative Tools** and then Double-click **Windows Firewall with Advanced Security** .  
    3.  Select **Inbound Rules.**  
    4.  Select **CoreNetworking - Teredo (UDP-In).**  
    5.  Right click, select **Properties.**  
    6.  Select “**Block the connections** ”.  
    7.  Select **Outbound Rules.**  
    8.  Select **Core Networking - Teredo (UDP-Out).**  
    9.  Right click, select **Properties.**  
    10. Select “**Block the connections** ”.
  
    **Impact of Workaround:** If you block Teredo network traffic using the custom Windows Firewall rule, applications that use the Teredo interface will not function properly or be accessible.
  
-   **Block Teredo UDP outbound traffic on perimeter firewalls.** 
  
    Blocking all outbound UDP traffic destined to port 3544 at the network perimeter will disallow affected Vista systems from communicating with external attempts to exploit the vulnerability.
  
    **Impact of Workaround:** Depending on network configuration, applications that use the Teredo interface will not function or be accessible outside of the network perimeter.
