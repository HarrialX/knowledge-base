Instructions:
The ASA and FTD configuration commands, set connection per-client-embryonic-max (TCP) and set connection per-client-max (TCP, UDP, and Stream Control Transmission Protocol {SCTP}), can be configured to limit the number of connection requests allowed. Using these configuration parameters can reduce the number of connections and greatly reduce the impact of the DoS attack.
