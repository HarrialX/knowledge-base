Workarounds for MSN Messenger Webcam or Video Chat Session Remote Code Execution Vulnerability â€“ CVE-2007-2931
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you perform the upgrade. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Block MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger traffic by using ISA Server. See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 925120.
Impact of workaround. This prevents MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger traffic from entering or leaving your enterprise.

Block select network ports for MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger. See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 927847.
Impact of workaround. This allows administrators to selectively prevent webcam and video chat sessions, as opposed to blocking MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger traffic completely.
