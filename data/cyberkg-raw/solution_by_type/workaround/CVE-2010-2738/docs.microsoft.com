Workarounds for Uniscribe Font Parsing Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2738
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Modify the Access Control List (ACL) on usp10.dll
Modify the ACL on usp10.dll to be more restrictive.
For 32-bit editions of Windows XP, run the following commands from a command prompt with administrative privileges:
cacls %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\usp10.DLL /E /P everyone:N
For 64-bit editions of Windows XP, run the following commands from a command prompt with administrative privileges:
cacls %WINDIR%\SYSWOW64\usp10.DLL /E /P everyone:N 
For 32-bit editions of Windows Vista and Windows 7, run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:
takeown /f %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\usp10.DLL  
icacls %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\usp10.DLL /save %TEMP%\usp10_ACL.TXT  
icacls %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\usp10.DLL /deny everyone:(F)

For 64-bit editions of Windows Vista and Windows 7, run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:
takeown /f %WINDIR%\SYSWOW64\usp10.DLL  
icacls %WINDIR%\SYSWOW64\usp10.DLL /save %TEMP%\usp10_ACL.TXT  
icacls %WINDIR%\SYSWOW64\usp10.DLL /deny everyone:(F)

Impact of workaround. FireFox may not load. Some fonts may not render properly.
How to undo the workaround.
For 32-bit editions of Windows XP, run the following commands from a command prompt with administrative privileges:
cacls %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\usp10.dll /E /R everyone
For 64-bit editions of Windows XP, run the following commands from a command prompt with administrative privileges:
cacls %WINDIR%\SYSWOW64\usp10.dll /E /R everyone 
For 32-bit editions of Windows Vista and Windows 7, run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:
icacls %windir%\system32 /restore %TEMP%\up10_ACL.TXT
For 64-bit editions of Windows Vista and Windows 7, run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:
icacls %windir%\syswow64 /restore %TEMP%\usp10_ACL.TXT

Disable support for parsing embedded fonts in Internet Explorer
Disabling the support for the parsing of embedded fonts in Internet Explorer prevents this application from being used as an attack vector. However, additional attack vectors, such as embedded fonts within a Microsoft Office document, could still succeed.
Using the Interactive Method

In Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the Tools menu
Click the Security tab
Click Internet, and then click Custom Level
Scroll down to the Downloads section and select Prompt or Disable for the Font Downloading security setting
Click OK two times to return to Internet Explorer

Using Group Policy
Note The Group Policy MMC snap-in can be used to set policy for a machine, for an organizational unit or an entire domain. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:

Group Policy collection
What is Group Policy Object Editor?
Core Group Policy tools and settings

Perform the following steps:

Open the Group Policy Management Console and configure the console to work with the appropriate Group Policy object, such as local machine, OU, or domain GPO.
Navigate to the following node:
User Configuration - Windows Settings - Internet Explorer - Maintenance - Security
Double-click Security Zones and Content Rating.
In the Security Zones and Content Rating dialog box, select Import the current security zones and privacy settings and then click the Modify Settings button.
Note This will create a Group Policy for Internet Explorer based on the settings of the currently logged-on user.
In the Internet Properties dialog box, ensure the Internet zone is selected and then click Custom Level.
Scroll down to Downloads and set Font Download to Prompt or Disable.
Click OK to return to the Internet Properties dialog box.
Repeat these steps for the Local Intranet zone.
Click OK three times to return to the Group Policy Management Console.
Refresh the Group Policy on all machines or wait for the next scheduled Group Policy refresh interval for the settings to take effect.

Using a Managed Deployment Script
This security setting can be manually entered into the registry by creating a registry script and importing it either by double-clicking it or running regedit.exe as part of a logon or machine startup script. For managed deployments Regedit.exe can be used to import a registry script silently with the /s switch. For more information on regedit command line switches, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 82821, "Registration Info Editor (REGEDIT) Command-Line Switches."
To set to Prompt for the Internet and Local Intranet Zones, paste the following text into a .REG file and then import the .REG file on managed machines as part of your organization's managed deployment process:
; Zone 1 is the local intranet zone
; 1604 is the Font download policy
; dword:00000001 sets the policy to prompt
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\1]
"1604"=dword:00000001
; Zone 3 is the internet zone
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\3]
"1604"=dword:00000001

To set to Disable for the Internet and Local Intranet Zones, paste the following text into a .REG file and then import the .REG file on managed machines as part of your organization's managed deployment process:
; Zone 1 is the local intranet zone
; 1604 is the Font download policy
; dword:00000003 sets the policy to disable
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\1]
"1604"=dword:00000003
; Zone 3 is the internet zone
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\3]
"1604"=dword:00000003

Impact of workaround. Web pages that make use of embedded font technology will fail to display properly.
