Workarounds for Kerberos Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1981:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Block UDP and TCP port 88 at the firewall
These ports are used to initiate a connection with Kerberos. Blocking them at the firewall will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports.
