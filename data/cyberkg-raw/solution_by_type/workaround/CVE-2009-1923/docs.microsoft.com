#### Workarounds for WINS Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1923
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   Block TCP port 42 and UDP port 42 at your firewall.
  
    These ports are used to initiate a connection with a remote WINS server. Blocking these ports at the firewall will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from being attacked by attempts to exploit this vulnerability. It is possible that other ports may be found that could be used to exploit this vulnerability. The ports that are listed are the most common attack vectors. We recommend blocking all inbound unsolicited communication from the Internet.
