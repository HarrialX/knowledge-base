Workarounds for Internet Information Services Using Malformed Active Server Pages Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0026:
We have not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.
FAQ Workarounds for Internet Information Services Malformed Active Server Pages Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0026:
What is the scope of the vulnerability?
There is a remote code execution vulnerability in Internet Information Services (IIS) that results from the way that IIS handles Active Server Pages (ASP). An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Active Server Pages (ASP) file, which could potentially allow remote code execution if the Internet Information Services (IIS) processed the file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.
What causes the vulnerability?
An unchecked buffer in IIS.
What is Active Server Pages (ASP)?
Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP) is a server-side scripting technology that can be used to create dynamic and interactive Web applications. An ASP page is an HTML page that contains server-side scripts that are processed by the Web server before being sent to the user's browser.
What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.
Who could exploit the vulnerability?
An attacker would require valid logon credentials to the server in order to exploit the vulnerability. However if a server had been purposely configured to allow users, either anonymous or authenticated, to upload web content such as .ASP pages to web sites, the server could be attacked by exploit this vulnerability.
How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?
An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted ASP file and uploading the file to an affected system. If IIS processed the file it could then cause the affected system to execute code.
What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?
Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 systems running IIS 5.0 are primarily at risk from this vulnerability because IIS is enabled by default. Windows XP Professional and Windows Server 2003 are also at risk if the service is enabled.
Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?
Yes. An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet if they are granted access to write to the server. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect against attacks that originate from the Internet. Microsoft has provided information about how you can help protect your PC. End users can visit the Protect Your PC Web site. IT professionals can visit the Security Guidance Center Web site.
When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.
When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

Administrators should use one of the supported methods to verify the installation was successful when they use the /quiet switch. Administrators should also review the KB917537.log file for any failure messages when they use this switch.
To install the security update without forcing the system to restart, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows 2000 Service Pack 4:
Windows2000-kb917537-x86-enu /norestart
For more information about how to deploy this security update with Software Update Services, visit the Software Update Services Web site. For more information about how to deploy this security update using Windows Server Update Services, visit the Windows Server Update Services Web site. This security update will also be available through the Microsoft Update Web site.
Restart Requirement
This update does not require a restart. The installer stops the required services, applies the update, and then restarts the services. However, if the required services cannot be stopped for any reason, or if required files are being used, this update will require a restart. If this behavior occurs, a message appears that advises you to restart.
To help reduce the chance that a reboot will be required, stop all affected services and close all applications that may use the affected files prior to installing the security update. For more information about the reasons why you may be prompted to restart your computer, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 887012.
Removal Information
To remove this security update, use Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel.
System administrators can also use the Spuninst.exe utility to remove this security update. The Spuninst.exe utility is located in the %Windir%\$NTUninstallKB917537$\Spuninst folder.

Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied

Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer
To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site.

File Version Verification
Note Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

Click Start, and then click Search.
In the Search Results pane, click All files and folders under Search Companion.
In the All or part of the file name box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click Search.
In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click Properties.
Note Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
On the Version tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
Note Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.


Registry Key Verification
You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows 2000\SP5\KB917537\Filelist
Note This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 917537 security update into the Windows installation source files.

Office Update

Software Update Services:
By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.
For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the Software Update Services Web site.
Windows Server Update Services:
By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.
For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the Windows Server Update Services Web site.
Systems Management Server:
Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site. SMS 2.0 users can also use Software Updates Service Feature Pack to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the SMS Web site.
Note SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following Web site. Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack and in the SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack) to install these updates.
