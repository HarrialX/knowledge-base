Workarounds for Object Packager Insecure Executable Launching Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0009
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Disable the WebClient service
Disabling the WebClient service helps protect affected systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability by blocking the most likely remote attack vector through the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service. After applying this workaround it is still possible for remote attackers who successfully exploit this vulnerability to cause the system to run programs located on the targeted user's computer or the Local Area Network (LAN), but users will be prompted for confirmation before opening arbitrary programs from the Internet.
To disable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

Click Start, click Run, type Services.msc and then click OK.
Right-click WebClient service and select Properties.
Change the Startup type to Disabled. If the service is running, click Stop.
Click OK and exit the management application.

Impact of workaround. When the WebClient service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. In addition, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. For example, WebDAV shares will be inaccessible from the client computer.
How to undo the workaround.
To re-enable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

Click Start, click Run, type Services.msc and then click OK.
Right-click WebClient service and select Properties.
Change the Startup type to Automatic. If the service is not running, click Start.
Click OK and exit the management application.


Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall
These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, TCP and UDP Port Assignments.
Impact of workaround. Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:

Applications that use SMB (CIFS)
Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
Server (File and Print Sharing)
Group Policy
Net Logon
Distributed File System (DFS)
Terminal Server Licensing
Print Spooler
Computer Browser
Remote Procedure Call Locator
Fax Service
Indexing Service
Performance Logs and Alerts
Systems Management Server
License Logging Service

How to undo the workaround. Unblock TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see TCP and UDP Port Assignments.

Register packager.exe with a full path
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
We recommend that you back up the registry before you edit it.
To register package.exe with a full path, perform the following steps:

Click Start, click Run, type regedit, and then click OK.

Expand HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, then Package, then Protocol, then StdFileEditing, then Server.

Click on the (Default) key and change the value to:
C:\Windows\System32\Packager.exe 

Note Substitute the appropriate system path for your system.
