Instructions:
Because RMI transactions start with a connection to the RMI registry port, which by default is TCP port 1099 or 9099 depending on the Cisco Prime DCNM version, allowing only legitimate devices to connect to the RMI registry port can mitigate this vulnerability.

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the companion document "Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager Remote Command Execution Vulnerability," which is available at the following link:
