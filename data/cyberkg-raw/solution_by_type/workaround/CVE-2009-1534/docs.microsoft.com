Workarounds for Office Web Components Memory Allocation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0562
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

Prevent Office Web Components Library from running in Internet Explorer.
You can prevent the Office Web Components Library from running in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
Note We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.
Note This is the action taken by the ISA Server update package. No binaries are included in this update for ISA Server.
For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Office Web Components, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797. Follow these steps in this article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent the Office Web Components library from running.
Note The Class Identifiers and corresponding files where the library objects are contained are documented in the FAQ "What does the update do?"

To set the kill bit for a CLSID with a value of {0002E543-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} and {0002E55B-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{0002E543-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}]
"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{0002E55B-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}]

You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:

Group Policy Collection
What is Group Policy Object Editor?
Core Group Policy Tools and Settings

Note You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.
Impact of Workaround: After the kill bit is set, you will no longer be able to use the OWC Spreadsheet functionality within the Office Web Components ActiveX Control in Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office, or any application that honors kill bits. This will not affect the standard operation of Microsoft Office and most users will not notice any change after setting the kill bit. OWC is primarily used by Web applications, including internal business applications, Microsoft Office Project Web Access, and the Office 2003 Add-in: Web Parts and Components. It may also be used in some VBA solutions within Microsoft Office. Once the kill bit is set, these applications will not be able to use any functionality that relies on the OWC Spreadsheet control within the Office Web Components ActiveX Control.
How to undo the Workaround: You can undo the workaround documented above by following these steps:
Warning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk.

Unregister the Office Web Components Library
Note This action will not work on an ISA Server computer because:

The Office Web components are installed in the ISA Server program directory (“%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft ISA Server” by default)
The Office Web Components are re-registered by the ISA Server report job mechanism each time a report job is executed.

Regsvr32.exe "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Components\11\owc11.dll"


Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites
After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.
To do this, follow these steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Tools, click Internet Options, and then click the Security tab.
In the Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings box, click Trusted Sites, and then click Sites.
If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone check box.
In the Add this Web site to the zone box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click Add.
Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
Click OK two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are "*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" and "*.update.microsoft.com" (without the quotation marks). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX control to install the update.

Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to prompt before running ActiveX controls in these zones
You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.
To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click Internet Options.
In the Internet Options dialog box, click the Security tab, and then click the Internet icon.
Under Security level for this zone, move the slider to High. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

Note If no slider is visible, click Default Level, and then move the slider to High.
Note Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites
After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.
To do this, follow these steps:

In Internet Explorer, click Tools, click Internet Options, and then click the Security tab.
In the Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings box, click Trusted Sites, and then click Sites.
If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone check box.
In the Add this Web site to the zone box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click Add.
Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
Click OK two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are "*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" and "*.update.microsoft.com" (without the quotation marks). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX control to install the update.

Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to prompt before running ActiveX controls in these zones
You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.
To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click Internet Options.
In the Internet Options dialog box, click the Security tab, and then click the Internet icon.
Under Security level for this zone, move the slider to High. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

Note If no slider is visible, click Default Level, and then move the slider to High.
Note Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.
