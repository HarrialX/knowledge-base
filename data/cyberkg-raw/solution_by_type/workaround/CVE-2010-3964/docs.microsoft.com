#### Workarounds for Malformed Request Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3964
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Stop and Disable Office Document Conversions Launcher Service**
  
    Run the following command from a command prompt as an administrator on each system running the Document Conversions Launcher Service:  
    `sc stop dclauncher`  
`sc config dclauncher start= disabled`

**Impact of Workaround.** Office document conversion is disabled.

**How to undo the workaround.**

Run the following command from a command prompt as an administrator:  
`sc config dclauncher start= auto`  

`sc start dclauncher`


Block ports used by the Office Document Conversions Launcher Service at the firewall
Block the following port at the firewall:
TCP Port 8082
This port is used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking this port at the enterprise firewall, both inbound and outbound, will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, TCP and UDP Port Assignments.
Impact of Workaround. Applications and services may use the affected port. Blocking connectivity to the port may cause various applications or services to not function.
How to undo the workaround.
Unblock TCP port 8082 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, TCP and UDP Port Assignments.
