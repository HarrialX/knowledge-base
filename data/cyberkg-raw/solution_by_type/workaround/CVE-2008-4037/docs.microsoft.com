#### Workarounds for SMB Credential Reflection Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4037
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall**
  
    These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:
  
    -   Applications that use SMB (CIFS)  
    -   Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)  
    -   Server (File and Print Sharing)  
    -   Group Policy  
    -   Net Logon  
    -   Distributed File System (DFS)  
    -   Terminal Server Licensing  
    -   Print Spooler  
    -   Computer Browser  
    -   Remote Procedure Call Locator  
    -   Fax Service  
    -   Indexing Service  
    -   Performance Logs and Alerts  
    -   Systems Management Server  
    -   License Logging Service
  
-   **Enable SMB signing**
  
    Enabling SMB signing prevents the attacker from executing code in the context of the logged-on user. Microsoft recommends using Group Policies to configure SMB signing. For detailed instructions on using Group Policies to enable and disable SMB signing for Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 887429](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/887429). The instructions in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 887429](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/887429) for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 also apply to Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Using SMB packet signing can degrade performance on file service transactions. Computers that have this policy set will not communicate with computers that do not have client-side packet signing enabled. For more information on SMB signing and potential impacts, see [Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always)](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc786681.aspx).
