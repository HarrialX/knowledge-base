#### Workarounds for TLS/SSL Renegotiation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3555
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Enable SSLAlwaysNegoClientCert on IIS 6 and above**
  
    Web servers running IIS 6 and later that are affected because they require mutual authentication by requesting a client certificate can be hardened by enabling the SSLAlwaysNegoClientCert setting. This will cause IIS to prompt the client for a certificate upon the initial connection, and does not require a server-initiated renegotiation.
  
    **Impact of Workaround:** Setting this flag will require the client to authenticate prior to loading any element from the SSL-protected web site. This will cause the browser to always prompt the user for a client certificate upon connecting to the SSL protected web site. If mutual authentication is *not* required for the SSL protected content, users who are prompted to select a certificate can simply dismiss the dialog box to view the content over the SSL connection without having to select a client certificate to authenticate with.
  
    **For IIS 6:**
  
    Run the following command from the "c:\\inetpub\\adminscripts" folder in an elevated / administrator command prompt:
  
    `adsutil.vbs SET w3svc/
WScript.Echo("Value of SSLAlwaysNegoClientCert Before: " + vdirObj.SSLAlwaysNegoClientCert);
vdirObj.Put("SSLAlwaysNegoClientCert", true);
vdirObj.SetInfo();
WScript.Echo("Value of SSLAlwaysNegoClientCert After: " + vdirObj.SSLAlwaysNegoClientCert);
```

Run the following command from an elevated / administrator command prompt:

`cscript.exe enable_ssl_renegotiate_workaround.js`
