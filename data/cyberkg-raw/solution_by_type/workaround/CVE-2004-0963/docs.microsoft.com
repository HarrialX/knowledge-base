Workarounds for Buffer Overrun in Microsoft Word CAN-2004-0963:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

Do not open Microsoft Word documents from unknown or untrusted sources.

Enable prompting for Office documents so that they will not auto-open.
Note By default, Internet Explorer will prompt the user to Open/Save As the document. However, if this functionality has been turned off, the documents will automatically be opened. To re-enable this functionality:

Go to My Computer and click on Tools, then click Folder Options.
Select the File Types tab
For each Office file type, highlight and click Advanced
Verify that the Confirm open after download setting is checked
Uncheck the setting to Browse in same Window
Select Ok and Close

Impact of Workaround:
Microsoft Office will now prompt the user to Open/Save As instead of allowing for malicious code to automatically be run.
