Workarounds for Server Service Denial of Service Vulnerability- CVE-2006-3942:
Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Block the following at the firewall:      -   UDP ports 135, 137, 138, and 445, and TCP ports 135, 139, and 445.

To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, such as the Internet Connection Firewall, which is included with Windows XP and with Windows Server 2003.
By default, the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows XP and in Windows Server 2003 helps protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. We recommend that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet. In Windows XP Service Pack 2 this features is called the Windows Firewall.
To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

Click Start, and then click Control Panel.
In the default Category View, click Network and Internet Connections, and then click Setup or change your home or small office network. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your system is connected directly to the Internet.

To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection, follow these steps:

Click Start, and then click Control Panel.
In the default Category View, click Networking and Internet Connections, and then click Network Connections.
Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click Properties.
Click the Advanced tab.
Click to select the Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet check box, and then click OK.

Note If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, click Settings on the Advanced tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services that are required.

To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems.
Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190 and Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878.
