#### Mitigating Factors for Office for Mac Improper Folder Permissions Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1894
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability.  
-   An attacker could use the vulnerability to place a malicious executable in the Microsoft Office 2011 folder. However, the attacker would only be able to gain elevated privileges on the affected Mac computer if a user runs the malicious executable. This is not a direct elevation of privilege, but rather it is a luring attack.  
-   This vulnerability does not affect Office for Mac 2011 installations in an upgrade scenario to Service Pack 2.
