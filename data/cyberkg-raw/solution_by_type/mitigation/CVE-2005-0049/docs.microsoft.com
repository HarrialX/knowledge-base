Mitigating Factors for Cross-site Scripting and Spoofing Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0049:
Mitigating factors for cross-site scripting attacks:

An attacker who successfully exploited the cross-site scripting aspect of this vulnerability would gain only the same permissions as the user.

Mitigating factors for putting spoofed content in a user’s Web browser cache:

Clients who have turned on the Do not save encrypted pages to disk advanced Internet option in Internet Explorer would not be at risk from any attempts to put spoofed content into the client cache if they accessed their Web site through the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

Mitigating factors for putting spoofed content in an intermediate proxy server cache”

Clients who use SSL-protected connections to access the affected Web sites would not be vulnerable to attempts to put spoofed content on intermediate proxy server caches. This is because SSL session data is encrypted and is not cached on intermediate proxy servers.
If spoofed content is successfully put in an intermediate proxy server’s cache, it could be difficult for an attacker to predict which users would be served the spoofed cached content.
An attacker must be able to log on the affected Web site to try to exploit this vulnerability. If you do not allow anonymous access to your Web site, only authenticated users could try to exploit this vulnerability.
