Mitigating Factors for SharePoint Scripting Vulnerability - CVE-2007-2581
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

In a Web-based attack scenario, Web sites that accept or host user-provided content, or compromised Web sites and advertisement servers could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that contains a specially-crafted URL with embedded Javascript.
In the information disclosure scenario, clients that have the advanced Internet option, Do not save encrypted pages to disk, turned on in Internet Explorer would not be at risk from any attempts to put spoofed content into the client cache if the clients accessed SharePoint site through the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
