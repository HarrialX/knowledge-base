#### Mitigating Factors for TrueType Font Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2011-2004
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   For an attack to be successful, a user must visit an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share containing a specially crafted TrueType font file, or open the file as an e-mail attachment. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to perform these actions. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to do so, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message.  
-   The file sharing protocol SMB is often disabled on the perimeter firewall. This limits the potential remote attack vectors for this vulnerability.
