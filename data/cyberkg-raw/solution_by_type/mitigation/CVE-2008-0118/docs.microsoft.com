#### Mitigating Factors for the Microsoft Office Cell Parsing Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0113
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's site.  
-   The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.  
-   Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and Office 2003.  
-   Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3 is not affected by this vulnerability.  
-   2007 Microsoft Office System is not affected by this vulnerability.
