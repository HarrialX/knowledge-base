Mitigating Factors for GDI Local Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2006-5758 :

An attacker must be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.

Mitigating Factors for WMF Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2007-1211:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who convinced a user to open a specially crafted file or to view a folder that contains the specially crafted image. There is no way for an attacker to force a user to open a specially crafted file, except potentially through previewing an e-mail message.

Mitigating Factors for EMF Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2007-1212:
We have not identified any mitigations for this vulnerability.
Mitigating Factors for GDI Invalid Window Size Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2006-5586:
An attacker must be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.
Mitigating Factors for Windows Animated Cursor Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0038:

Customers who are using Windows Internet Explorer 7 on Windows Vista are protected from currently known web based attacks due to Internet Explorer Protected Mode. For more information on Internet Explorer Protected Mode see the following Windows Web site.
By default, Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 uses Microsoft Word to display e-mail messages which protects customers from the HTML e-mail preview and attack vector.
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could also attempt to compromise a Web site to have it serve up a Web page with malicious content attempting to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or a site compromised by the attacker.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

Mitigating Factors for GDI Incorrect Parameter Local Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2007-1215:
An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users
Mitigating Factors for Font Rasterizer Local Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2007-1213:
Attempts to exploit this vulnerability will most probably result in a denial of service condition caused by an unexpected restart of the affected system rather than local elevation of privilege.
