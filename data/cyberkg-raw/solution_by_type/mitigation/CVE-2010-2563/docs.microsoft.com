#### Mitigating Factors for WordPad Word 97 Text Converter Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2563
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.  
-   The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message. The user would be prompted to decide if they wanted to open the file or not, unless the user had previously unchecked the option "Always ask before opening this type of file."  
-   Systems where Microsoft Word is installed will typically open Word documents with Microsoft Office instead of WordPad by default.
