Mitigating Factors for Indeo Codec Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3138
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

The file sharing protocol, Server Message Block (SMB), is often disabled on the perimeter firewall. This limits the potential attack vectors for this vulnerability.
For an attack to be successful, a user must visit an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share and open a media file (such as an .avi file).
