Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Office Excel Remote Code Execution Using a Malformed Range Vulnerability - CVE-2005-4131:

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
When running Office XP or Office 2003, the vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
On Office XP and Office 2003, this vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through a Web-based attack scenario. An attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

Note This vulnerability could be exploited automatically when using Office 2000. Office 2000 does not prompt the user to Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document.
