Mitigating Factors for RIS Writable Path Vulnerability - CVE-2006-5584:

The attacker must be able to TFTP to the Remote Installation Server to place a specially crafted file or program.
The Remote Install Service is not installed by default on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4.
For customers who require the affected component, firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
