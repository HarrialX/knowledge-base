Mitigating Factors for WordPad and Office Text Converter Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0087
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative privileges.
All supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 are at a reduced risk to this vulnerability because the affected component is disabled by default. These operating systems are only vulnerable if an administrator has manually enabled the affected component. All supported editions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 do not contain the affected component and are also unaffected.
Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 systems are more at risk because the converter is still active in a default installation. However, on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 systems that have applied the MS04-041 update, the Word for Windows 6.0 converter will be disabled by default.
Users who have installed and are using the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool for Office 2000 will be prompted with Open, Save, or Cancelbefore opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and later editions of Office.

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
