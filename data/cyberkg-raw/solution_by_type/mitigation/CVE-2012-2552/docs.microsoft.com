Mitigating Factors for Reflected XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2012-2552
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's website.
The XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8, Internet Explorer 9, and Internet Explorer 10 prevents this attack for Internet Explorer 8, Internet Explorer 9, and Internet Explorer 10 users when browsing to websites in the Internet Zone. Note that the XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8, Internet Explorer 9, and Internet Explorer 10 is enabled by default in the Internet zone, but is not enabled by default in the Intranet Zone.
