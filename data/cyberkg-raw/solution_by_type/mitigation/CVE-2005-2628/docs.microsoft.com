Mitigating Factors for Flash Player Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0024:

Customers that have followed the guidance in Adobe Security Bulletin APSB06-03 are not at risk from the vulnerability.
By default, Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 do not ship with a vulnerable version of Flash Player installed. However, customers that have installed a version of Flash Player 7.0.62.0 or 8.0.22.0 or earlier on these versions of Windows are encouraged to follow the guidance in the Adobe Security Bulletin APSB06-03.
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail. However, if a user clicks on a link within an e-mail they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario described previously.
By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally Outlook 2000 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018 has been installed.
