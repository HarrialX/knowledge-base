Mitigating Factors for Shell Vulnerability- CAN-2005-2122:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform an action. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
To exploit this vulnerability locally the attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.

Mitigating Factors for Web View Script Injection Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2117:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform an action. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful through e-mail a user must save an attachment locally and then preview it in Windows Explorer.
