#### Mitigating Factors for File Change Notification Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0074
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   On Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003, the IUSR\_MACHINENAME account (used for anonymous access) does not have write access to the WWW root folders by default.  
-   The specially crafted file or folder that would be required to exploit this vulnerability must be created locally. It could not be created through an FTP client connected to the FTP server service.  
-   On Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Vista, IIS is not installed or enabled by default.
