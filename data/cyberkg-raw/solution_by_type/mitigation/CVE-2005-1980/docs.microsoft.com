Mitigating Factors for MSDTC Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2119:

Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 systems are not vulnerable to this issue.
By default, on Windows Server 2003, the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator is started, but it is not configured to support Network DTC Access. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. However, if an administrator has enabled support for Network DTC Access, Windows Server 2003 systems could be vulnerable to remote code execution attacks by anonymous users. For information about how to configure Network DTC Access, visit the following Microsoft Web site.
By default, on Windows XP Service Pack 1 and Windows 2000 Professional, the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator is not started. This service must be running to enable the remote attack vector. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. However, any local user can start this service unless the service has been disabled by an administrator. As soon as this service is started, Windows XP Service Pack 1 systems could be vulnerable to remote code execution attacks by anonymous users. This is because on Windows XP Service Pack 1 systems, the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator service is configured to allow Network DTC Access. For information about how to configure Network DTC Access, visit the following Microsoft Web site.
For customers who require the affected component, firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

Mitigating Factors for COM+ Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1978:

On Windows XP Service Pack 2, on Windows Server 2003, and on Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 an attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely unless the attacker already has administrative permissions.
Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

Mitigating Factors for TIP Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1979:

This is a denial of service vulnerability. This issue would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights, but it could cause the affected service to stop accepting requests.
On Windows XP Service Pack 1, Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, even if the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator is started, the TIP protocol is not enabled. An administrator must manually enable the TIP protocol for the Distributed Transaction Coordinator to become vulnerable to this issue.
If the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator stops responding because of an attack, services that are not dependant on the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator would continue to function normally.
For customers who require the affected component, firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

Mitigating Factors for Distributed TIP Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1980:

This is a denial of service vulnerability. This issue would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights, but it could cause the affected services to stop accepting requests.
On Windows XP Service Pack 1, Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, even if the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator is started, the TIP protocol is not enabled. An administrator must manually enable the TIP protocol for the Distributed Transaction Coordinator to become vulnerable to this issue.
