#### Mitigating Factors for UAG Blind HTTP Redirect Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0146
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link that has a specially crafted URL that redirects the user to the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's website.
