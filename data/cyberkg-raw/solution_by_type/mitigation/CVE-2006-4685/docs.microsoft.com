Mitigating Factors for Microsoft XML Core Services Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4685:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the page. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or instant messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

This mode mitigates this vulnerability from sites that are not explicitly allowed to run script and ActiveX controls. See the FAQ section of this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
