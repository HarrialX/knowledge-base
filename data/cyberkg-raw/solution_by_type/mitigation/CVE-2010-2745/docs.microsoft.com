Mitigating Factors for Windows Media Player Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2745
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâ€™s Web site.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
Supported editions of Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 are not affected by this issue unless the Desktop Experience feature is installed. By default, these platforms do not load the affected Windows Media Player component. For more information on the Desktop Experience feature, see the TechNet article, Desktop Experience Overview.
