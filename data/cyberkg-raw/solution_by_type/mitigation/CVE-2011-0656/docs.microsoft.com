Mitigating Factors for Floating Point Techno-color Time Bandit RCE Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0655
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted PowerPoint file.
The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
In Microsoft PowerPoint 2010, the possibility of an attacker's success in exploiting this vulnerability is reduced due to the protections afforded by the Office File Validation feature enabled in Microsoft Office 2010 by default. Specially crafted files used to exploit the vulnerability open in Protected View and the user is warned that the file is unsafe and potentially harmful because the file failed validation. A user would have to click through multiple warnings and then open the file for editing or saving before the vulnerability could be exploited. For more information about Protected View and Office File Validation, see the TechNet article, Security Overview for Office 2010.
Note  Turning off Office File Validation in Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 would remove the protections provided by Office File Validation as a mitigating factor. For this reason, Microsoft recommends not turning off the Office File Validation feature in Microsoft PowerPoint 2010.
