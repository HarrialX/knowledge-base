Mitigating Factors for Visual Basic for Applications Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1854
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

The file sharing protocol, Server Message Block (SMB), is often disabled on the perimeter firewall. This limits the potential attack vectors for this vulnerability.
For an attack to be successful, a user must visit an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share and open a legitimate Office-related file (such as a .docx file).
Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
