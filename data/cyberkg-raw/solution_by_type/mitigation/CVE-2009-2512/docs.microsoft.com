#### Mitigating Factors for Web Services on Devices API Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2512
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.  
-   Only attackers on the local subnet would be able to exploit this vulnerability without interaction. Even on private networks, the vulnerable service is only exposed to incoming connections from the local subnet in the Windows firewall.
