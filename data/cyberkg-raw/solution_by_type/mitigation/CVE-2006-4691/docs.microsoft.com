Mitigating Factors for Workstation Service Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4691:

Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
For Windows Server 2003 the affected component is not vulnerable.
On Windows XP Service Pack 2 the attack could only be successfully performed by a user with Administrator privileges.
