Mitigating Factors for SNMP Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-5583:

SNMP service is not installed by default in any supported version of Windows.
For customers who require the affected component, firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
