Mitigating Factors for Print Spooler Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1984:

On Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003, this vulnerability is restricted to authenticated users. Additionally, in order for this issue to create a remote attack vector on these operating system versions, a local user who has appropriate permissions must first share a printer or try to connect to a shared printer. If no user with appropriate permissions has shared a printer or tries to connect to a shared printer, an attacker would have to have valid logon credentials and must be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability.
On Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003, this issue would result in a denial of service condition. On Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003, this issue cannot be exploited for remote code execution or for elevation of privilege.
On other operating system versions, attacks attempting to exploit this vulnerability would most likely result in a denial of service condition. However remote code execution could be possible.
Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
