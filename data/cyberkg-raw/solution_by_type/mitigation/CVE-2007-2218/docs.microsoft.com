#### Mitigating Factors for Vulnerability in the Windows Schannel Security Package - CVE-2007-2218
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.  
-   Attempts to exploit this vulnerability will most probably result in a Denial of Service condition caused by an unexpected restart of the affected system rather than Remote Code Execution. On Windows 2000, the denial of service condition is limited to existing and new SSL and TLS connections whereas the system would still be available otherwise. On Windows Server 2003, a successful attack would cause the system to restart.
