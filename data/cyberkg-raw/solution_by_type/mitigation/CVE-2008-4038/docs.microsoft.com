Mitigating Factors for SMB Buffer Underflow Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4038
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. In this case, the SMB port should be blocked from the Internet.
Only authenticated users can trigger this vulnerability. This vulnerability can only be triggered if the user can authenticate against the remote system. However, if the Guest account is enabled, then guest users can trigger this vulnerability as well.
