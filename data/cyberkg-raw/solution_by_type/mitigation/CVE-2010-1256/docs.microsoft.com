#### Mitigating Factors for IIS Authentication Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1256
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   Without the installation of KB973917 on Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008, systems will not have the Extended Protection for Authentication feature and will not be vulnerable.  
-   Extended Protection for Authentication is not enabled by default on any affected platform, even when a system has installed KB973917. Systems are only affected when this feature is enabled.
