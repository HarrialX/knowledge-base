#### Mitigating Factors for ASP Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0075
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   IIS 5.1 is not part of a default install of Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2.  
-   On supported editions of Windows Server 2003, IIS is not installed or enabled by default.  
-   On supported editions of Windows Server 2003, if IIS is enabled, classic ASP is not installed or enabled by default.  
-   On supported editions of Windows Server 2003, if IIS is enabled and classic ASP is used, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could only obtain Network Service account privileges by default. By default, Network Service account privileges have the same user rights as an authenticated user.  
-   ASP.NET is not affected by this vulnerability. Customers who have only ASP.NET installed and not ASP are not at risk from this vulnerability.
