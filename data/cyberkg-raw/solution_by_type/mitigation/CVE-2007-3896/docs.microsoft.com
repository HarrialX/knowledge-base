Mitigating Factors for Windows URI Handling Vulnerability - CVE-2007-3896
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 is not affected
Windows Vista is not affected
Windows Vista x64 Edition is not affected
Microsoft has not identified a way to exploit this vulnerability on any Windows operating system that is running Internet Explorer 6
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
In an e-mail based attack of this exploit, customers who read e-mail in plain text are at less risk from this vulnerability. To be more at risk from this vulnerability, users would have to either click on a link that would take them to a malicious Web site or open an attachment.
