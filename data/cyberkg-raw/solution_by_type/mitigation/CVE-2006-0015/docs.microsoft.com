Mitigating Factors for Cross-site Scripting FrontPage Server Extensions Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0015:

By default, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0 is not enabled on Microsoft Windows Server 2003.
By default, FrontPage Server Extensions are not enabled on Microsoft Windows Server 2003.
You are not vulnerable if you have installed Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 on Windows Server 2000 Service Pack 4. You are also not vulnerable if you have installed Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.1 on Windows XP Service Pack 1 or on Windows XP Service Pack2 and if you have the default installation of FrontPage Server Extensions 2000.
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to know the name of the Front Page Server Extensions 2002 or SharePoint Team Services 2002 server to inject the malicious script. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must click a Web link that is sent in an e-mail message.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same rights as the userâ€™s rights on the Front Page Server Extensions 2002 or SharePoint Team Services 2002 server. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
