Mitigating Factors for XSS in inplview.aspx Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0017
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 users browsing to a SharePoint site in the Internet Zone are at a reduced risk because, by default, the XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 prevents this attack in the Internet Zone. The XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9, however, is not enabled by default in the Intranet Zone.
An attacker can cause arbitrary JavaScript to be run when the user clicks a specially crafted URL, but the attacker would not be able to steal the logged-on user's authentication credentials due to the way that SharePoint Server handles the HttpOnly authentication cookie.
