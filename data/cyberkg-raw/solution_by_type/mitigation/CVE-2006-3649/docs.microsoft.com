Mitigating Factors for Visual Basic for Applications Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3649:

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
In Outlook 2002 and Outlook 2003, the vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. A user would have to click on an attachment and then acknowledge a warning and accept a prompt to Open before the vulnerability could be exploited.
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or instant messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

Note Office 2000 products do not prompt the user to Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document.
