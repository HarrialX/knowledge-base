#### Mitigating Factors for TLS/SSL Renegotiation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3555
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   Web sites that do not host content via SSL, but only serve content via HTTP (clear text) connections are not affected.  
-   Internet Information Services (IIS) 6 and IIS 7 do not allow client-initiated renegotiation. This reduces the attack surface considerably. SSL sites where a user types in username and password are unlikely to be vulnerable. The most likely scenario that would allow spoofing with IIS 6 and IIS 7 is when client-side certificates are used to perform mutual authentication. This scenario is not common.  
-   Customers are only affected when an attacker is able to successfully conduct a man-in-the-middle attack by exploiting another vulnerability, such as a local subnet attack or DNS spoofing.
