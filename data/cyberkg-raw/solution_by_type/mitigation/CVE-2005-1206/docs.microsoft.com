Mitigating Factors for Server Message Block Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1206:

Because of the nature of this issue, attempts to exploit this vulnerability would most likely result in a denial of service.
Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. By default, the Windows Firewall that is provided as part of Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 blocks the affected ports from responding to network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability.
