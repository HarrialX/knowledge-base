#### Mitigating Factors for Heap Based Buffer Overflow in Outlook Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2728
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.  
-   By default, Microsoft Outlook 2003 and Microsoft Outlook 2007 connect to an Exchange server with Cached Exchange Mode. Outlook is not affected by the vulnerability when retrieving data from an Exchange server with Cached Exchange Mode. Cached Exchange Mode is not available in Microsoft Outlook 2002.  
-   A Microsoft Outlook client is not affected by the vulnerability when not connected to an Exchange server, such as when connected to a POP or IMAP server only.
