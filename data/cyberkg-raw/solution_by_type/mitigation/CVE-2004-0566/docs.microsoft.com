Mitigating Factors for Navigation Method Cross-Domain Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0549:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.

Customers who have installed both the update referenced in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-024 and have installed the ADODB.Stream update that is referenced in Knowledge Base Article 870669 will be at a reduced risk of this vulnerability resulting in remote code execution.

By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018 has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.
The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:

Apply the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-040 or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.
Use Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 or later and have applied the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018 or a later Cumulative Security Update for Outlook Express.
Use Microsoft Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 with the Microsoft Outlook E-mail Security Update installed
Use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or later or Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or later in their default configuration.


By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration that mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

The following products are not affected by this vulnerability.

Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 4 is not affected by this vulnerability.
Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 3 is not affected by this vulnerability.
Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 is not affected by this vulnerability.

Mitigating Factors for Malformed GIF File Double Free Vulnerability - CAN-2003-1048:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.
Because of the unique layout of the memory structures on each affected system, exploiting this vulnerability on a mass scale could potentially be difficult.
