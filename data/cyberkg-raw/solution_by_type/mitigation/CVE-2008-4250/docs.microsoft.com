#### Mitigating Factors for Server Service Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4250
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect network resources from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.  
-   On Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the vulnerable code path is only accessible to authenticated users. This vulnerability is not liable to be triggered if the attacker is not authenticated.
