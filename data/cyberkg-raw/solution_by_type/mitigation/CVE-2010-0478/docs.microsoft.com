#### Mitigating Factors for Media Services Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0478
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   Supported editions of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 are not affected by the vulnerability described in this bulletin.  
-   By default, Windows Media Services is not enabled on Microsoft Windows 2000 Server. In order for a Microsoft Windows 2000 Server to be vulnerable, the server would have to be configured as a streaming media server by adding the Windows Media Services component in the Windows Components Wizard.
