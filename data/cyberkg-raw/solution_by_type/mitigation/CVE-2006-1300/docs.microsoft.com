Mitigating Factors for .NET 2.0 Application Folder Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1300:

Directory browsing is not enabled by default on Application folder directories. An attacker would have to guess or know the names of the files they are attempting to retrieve or view.

By default, file extensions that are used by Visual Studio and ASP.NET web projects are mapped to the aspnet_isapi.dll System.Web.HttpForbiddenHandler and as a result, files with these extensions cannot be retrieved or viewed remotely using this vulnerability.
Here's the full list of file extensions that are protected (and not vulnerable): *.asax, *.ascx, *.master, *.skin, *.browser, *.sitemap, *.config (but not *.exe.config or *.dll.config), *.cs, *.csproj, *.vb, *.vbproj, *.webinfo, *.licx, *.resx, *.resources, *.mdb, *.vjsproj, *.java, *.dd, *.jsl, *.ldb, *.ad, *.ldd, *.sd, *.cd, *.adprototype, *.lddprototype, *.sdm, *.sdmDocument, *.mdf, *.ldf, *.exclude, *.refresh

IIS 6.0 will not send any file types that do not have a MIME mapping defined for the IIS 6.0. IIS 6.0 only stores the allowed MIME mappings in the metabase.
For example if a custom file type with a .data file extension is located in the ‘app_data’ folder on an IIS6 server, but there is no MIME association for .data files defined in IIS or the Windows Registry on that server, Internet Information Services (IIS) will not serve this type of file and will return a 404 error (regardless of what folder / directory the file resides in).

Customers using URLScan who have followed the guidance in Knowledge Base Article 815155 for hardening ASP.NET web applications are at less risk from this vulnerability.
