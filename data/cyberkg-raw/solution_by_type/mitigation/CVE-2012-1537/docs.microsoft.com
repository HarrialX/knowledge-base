Mitigating Factors for DirectPlay Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1537
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
The specially crafted Office document could be sent as an email attachment, but the attacker would have to convince the user to open the attachment in order to exploit the vulnerability.
By default, the DirectPlay ActiveX control is not included in the default allow-list for ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer. Only customers who have explicitly approved this control by using the ActiveX opt-in feature are at risk from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. However, if a customer has used this ActiveX control in a previous version of Internet Explorer, then this ActiveX control is enabled to work in Internet Explorer, even if the customer has not explicitly approved it using the ActiveX opt-in feature.
