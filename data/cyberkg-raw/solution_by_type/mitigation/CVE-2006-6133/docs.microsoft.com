Mitigating Factors for Crystal Reports RPT Processing Vulnerability â€“ CVE-2006-6133
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factor may be helpful in your situation:

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
In default configurations, RPT files are not registered to open with Crystal Reports for Visual Studio. Without the association, RPT files will not open using the affected software component when the user double-clicks on them.
