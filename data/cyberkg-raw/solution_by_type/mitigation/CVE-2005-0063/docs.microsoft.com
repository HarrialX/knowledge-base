Mitigating Factors for Windows Shell Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0063:

The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail or through a Web page. For an attack to be successful through e-mail a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
The vulnerability would generally be exploited through unregistered file name extension types. Systems that block unknown file name extension types or only allow known valid file name extension types would be at a reduced risk from this vulnerability.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative privileges.
