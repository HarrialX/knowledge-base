Mitigating Factors for Table Conversion Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0571:

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative privileges.
This vulnerability does not affect other Word documents, which are handled by separate converters.
Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 are at a reduced risk to this vulnerability because the affected component is disabled by default. These operating systems are only vulnerable if an administrator has manually enabled the affected component.
WordPad is vulnerable to this issue through .wri, .rtf, and .doc file name associations. By default, if any supported version of Microsoft Word is installed, through the .rtf and .doc file associations, these document types will open in Microsoft Word instead of WordPad. Microsoft Word does not contain this vulnerability. WordPad could also be used to manually open malicious documents; this could include files with file name extensions other than .wri, .rtf, and .doc because WordPad will process the malicious document the same regardless of the file name extension.
