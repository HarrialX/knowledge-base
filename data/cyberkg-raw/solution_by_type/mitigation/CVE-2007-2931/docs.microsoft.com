Mitigating Factors for MSN Messenger Webcam or Video Chat Session Remote Code Execution Vulnerability â€“ CVE-2007-2931
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would have to persuade a user to accept a webcam or video chat invitation in an MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger message. An attacker would have no way to force users to accept the webcam or video chat invitation. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to accept the webcam or video chat invitation.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
Users of Windows Live Messenger 8.1, released in January 2007, are already protected from this vulnerability. Users of MSN Messenger 7.0.0820, recently released, are also already protected from this vulnerability.
