#### Mitigating Factors for TLSv1 Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3229
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   The vulnerability can only be exploited on systems where an application or service is configured to receive incoming SSL connections. Systems that only initiate outgoing SSL connections cannot be exploited with this vulnerability.  
-   By default, all supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 are not configured to receive SSL network traffic.
