Mitigating Factors for Jet Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0197:

Windows NT 4.0 does not contain a version of the Microsoft Jet Database Engine (Jet) by default. However, other applications such as Microsoft Office or Microsoft Visual Studio could have installed Jet. Jet is also available as a stand-alone download. To determine if Jet is present on a system, search for the file named Msjet40.dll. If this file exists, this security update is required.
If the application that is communicating with Jet is using strong input validation, it is possible to filter the malicious input that an attacker is trying to submit to the Jet engine. Strong input validation means that all input is considered to be not trusted. Developing with strong input validation is considered to be a best practice. For more information about best practice application development and about application input validation, visit the MSDN Web site.
If an attacker successfully exploited this vulnerability, they would gain the same privileges as the user context of the application. Users or services whose accounts are configured to have few privileges on the system would be at less risk than users or services that operate with administrative or system privileges.
