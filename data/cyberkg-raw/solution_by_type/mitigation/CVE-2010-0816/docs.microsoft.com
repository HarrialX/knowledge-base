#### Mitigating Factors for Outlook Express and Windows Mail Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0816
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.  
-   An attacker cannot send a malicious e-mail to trigger this vulnerability.  
-   Customers using SSL encryption on top of POP3 or IMAP protocols are no longer vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks exploiting this vulnerability, and would only be affected if the client can be enticed to connect to a malicious or compromised e-mail server.
