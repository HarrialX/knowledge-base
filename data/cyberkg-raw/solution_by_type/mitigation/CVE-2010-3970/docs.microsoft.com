#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Shell Graphics Processing Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3970
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
