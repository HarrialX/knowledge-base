#### Mitigating Factors for MHTML Mime-Formatted Request Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0096
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, a Web site could contain a specially crafted link beginning with "MHTML:" that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site and open a specially crafted URL, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site, and then convincing them to click the specially crafted link.  
-   By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, removing the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.  
-   By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/security/szone/overview/esc_changes.asp). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. For more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration, see the FAQ entry in the next subsection, "I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?"
