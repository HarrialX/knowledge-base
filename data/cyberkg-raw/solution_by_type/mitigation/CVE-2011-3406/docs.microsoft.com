Mitigating Factors for Active Directory Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3406
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

In order to successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have member account credentials within the target Active Directory domain. However, the attacker does not need to have a workstation joined to the Active Directory domain.
Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
