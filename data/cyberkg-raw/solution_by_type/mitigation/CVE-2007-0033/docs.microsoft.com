Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Outlook VEVENT Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0033:

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
MAPI is not a valid attack vector for this issue due to Exchange's handling of iCal calendar data embedded in messages or in .ICS attachments.

Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Outlook Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1305:

The vulnerability is a denial of service vulnerability only. The attacker would not be able to access the user's e-mail or system in any way. The vulnerability could not be used to read, delete, create, or alter the user's e-mail.
If an attacker was able to send a malformed e-mail that successfully exploited this vulnerability, the malformed e-mail could be deleted either by an e-mail administrator, or by the user via another e-mail client such as Outlook Web Access or Outlook Express. Once the specially malformed e-mail has been removed, normal operation would resume.

Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Outlook Advanced Find Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0034:

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office Saved Searches (.oss) file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
