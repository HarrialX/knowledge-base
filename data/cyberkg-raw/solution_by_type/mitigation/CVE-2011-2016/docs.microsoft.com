Mitigating Factors for Windows Mail Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2011-2016
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

For an attack to be successful, a user must visit an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share and open a legitimate file (such as an .eml or .wcinv file) from this location that is then loaded by a vulnerable application.
The file sharing protocol, Server Message Block (SMB), is often disabled on the perimeter firewall. This limits the potential attack vectors for this vulnerability.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
On Windows Server 2008, Windows Mail and Windows Meeting Space are not installed by default. Windows Mail is only installed when the Desktop Experience is also installed.
Although the vulnerable code exists on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, Microsoft is unaware of any attack vectors that would allow exploitation of the vulnerability on these operating systems.
