Mitigating Factors for Excel Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0846

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. At this point a user could be exploited.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.
The vulnerability can not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful through e-mail, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
Excel 2001 for Mac users and Excel v. X for Mac users are prompted to download an Excel file before they open it. Therefore, a user may not be exploited by an attacker upon an initial visit to a web site.
Office XP Service Pack 3 is not affected by this vulnerability.
Office 2003 and Office 2003 Service Pack 1 are not affected by this vulnerability.
Excel 2004 for Mac is not affected by this vulnerability.
