Mitigating Factors for HyperTerminal Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0568:

By default, Windows Server 2003 does not install HyperTerminal. An administrator must manually install HyperTerminal. If HyperTerminal is installed, it is not set as the preferred Telnet client by default. However, it is still vulnerable to this issue through a specially-crafted HyperTerminal session file.
By default, Windows XP, Windows 2000 Server, and Windows NT 4.0 Server do not set HyperTerminal as the preferred Telnet client. However, they are still vulnerable to this issue through a specially-crafted HyperTerminal session file.
HyperTerminal, when used on Windows NT 4.0 cannot be set as the default Telnet client. However, Windows NT 4.0 is still vulnerable to this issue through a specially-crafted HyperTerminal session file.
Email management best practices that discourage users from opening file attachments with file extensions that are not familiar or that discourage users from opening file attachments from untrusted sources would help to mitigate this vulnerability. The affected file extension (.ht) is not normally used in email and should be treated with caution.
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site. If HyperTerminal has not been set as the default Telnet client, after they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions. If HyperTerminal has been set as the default Telnet client, no additional user interaction is required after the user clicks the link that an attacker provides.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative privileges.
