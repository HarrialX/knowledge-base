Mitigating Factors for COM Structured Storage Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0047:

An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.

Mitigating Factors for Input Validation Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0044:

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user or program that processed the malicious document. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability on Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003. For an attack to be successful by sending an e-mail message to a locally logged on user, the user must open an attachment that contains a malicious OLE object.
