Mitigating Factors for Help.aspx XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0817
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must click on a URL that is sent in an e-mail message.
