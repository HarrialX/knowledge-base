#### Mitigating Factors for Single Sign On Spoofing in ADFS Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2508
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   An attacker cannot choose whom to impersonate. An attacker can only impersonate someone whose authentication token the attacker has been able to obtain, for example, from an Internet kiosk.  
-   An attack is only possible before the session times out on the server. By default, sessions remain open for 600 minutes on the server. If an attacker tried to re-use a victim's authentication token after that time-out period has elapsed, the attack would fail.  
-   An attacker must have access to the authentication token used by the previous user on that terminal. In the case of an HTTPS-enabled server, that authentication token will have been protected in transit, and an attacker must have access to the victim's computer (for example, an Internet kiosk) to exploit the vulnerability. On an Internet kiosk, the user might sign in to an ADFS Single Sign-On (SSO) Web application, then sign off the application. An attacker could then use that computer to access the Web application as the previous user, even though the user has logged out.
  
#### Mitigating Factors for Remote Code Execution in ADFS Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2509
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   The attacker must have valid logon credentials to the vulnerable server. An attack can only be carried out after authenticating successfully to the server that supports ADFS.
