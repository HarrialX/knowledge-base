Mitigating Factors for IP Source Route Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2379:

Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
Systems are only at risk if IP Source Routing is enabled. IP Source Routing is disabled on Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 systems.
Enabling the Routing and Remote Access Service will enable IP Source Routing.Â  However, Routing and Remote Access is disabled on any affected operating system version.
Attacks attempting to exploit this vulnerability would most likely result in a denial of service condition. However remote code execution could be possible.
