Mitigating Factors for Web Client Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1207:

An attacker must have valid logon credentials to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited by anonymous users.
By default, the Web Client service is disabled in Windows Server 2003. An administrator would have to manually enable this service for the system to become vulnerable to this issue.
Attempts to exploit this vulnerability would most likely result in a denial of service condition.
Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. By default, the Internet Connection Firewall that is provided as part of Windows XP Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2003 blocks the affected ports from responding to network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability.
The Windows Server 2003 Security Guide recommends disabling the Web Client service. Environments that comply with these guidelines would be at a reduced risk from this vulnerability.
