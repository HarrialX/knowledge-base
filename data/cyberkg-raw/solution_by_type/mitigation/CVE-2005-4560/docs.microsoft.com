#### Mitigating Factors for Graphics Rendering Engine Vulnerability - CVE-2005-4560:
  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. Also, Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites, may contain malicious content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail or Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
