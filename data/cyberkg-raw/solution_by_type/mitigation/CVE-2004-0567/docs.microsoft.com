Mitigating Factors for Name Validation Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0567:

Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
By default, WINS is not installed on Windows NT Server 4.0, on Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, on Windows 2000 Server, or on Windows Server 2003. By default, WINS is installed and running on Microsoft Small Business Server 2000 and on Microsoft Windows Small Business Server 2003.
However, by default, on all versions of Microsoft Small Business Server, the WINS component communication ports are blocked from the Internet and WINS is available only on the local network.
On Windows Server 2003, attempts to exploit this vulnerability would most likely result in a denial of service. The WINS service automatically restarts if it fails. After the third automatic restart, WINS requires a manual restart to restore functionality.
